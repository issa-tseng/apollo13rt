55:46:46
CAPCOM
Okay FLIGHT, you read his pitch and yaw and his high-gain meter.

FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

CAPCOM
And now you want roll right to 060?

FLIGHT
Might as well do that. And we'll try and get Comet Bennett, I'd still like the verification on the docking angle because that's what we'll be using for computation for alignments and everything else. Let's see if there's anything else.

55:47:08
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
Okay, let's terminate the battery B charge at 55 +50.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
And at the same time, I'd sure like to have a cryo stir, all 4 tanks.

FLIGHT
Let's wait until they get settled down a little more.

EECOM
Roger.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

GNC
I would still like to enable the other two quads for the maneuver.

FLIGHT
Okay. When rolling to 060 you want them to enable C and D, right?

GNC
Right.

FLIGHT
Do you want them to disable A and B?

GNC
No.

FLIGHT
Okay. All four quads.

GNC
They have coupled jet maneuvers -

FLIGHT
Roger. Copy, CAPCOM?

CAPCOM
Got it.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

INCO
I'd like to confirm their configuration on their high-gain now.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
I'd like to know what track mode they're in and what SERVO electronics they're in.

FLIGHT
Okay, let's just standby 1 there. Now we'll C and D for roll to 060, terminate battery B charge.

55:48:10
FLIGHT
Okay, the third thing we want up there, CAPCOM, is to verify their high-gain configuration. And I assume what you want from there is you want to know their tracking, position of track - BEAM WIDTH you don't need, do you? Do you want the whole works?

INCO
Yeah, the whole works.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we want the configuration of the CSM high-gain.

55:49:34
INCO
That's good.

FLIGHT
Okay.

55:50:05
FLIGHT
Good report.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

GNC
Can we verify that they reenabled C-4 thruster?

FLIGHT
Okay. Verify that they re- - you're showing that disabled, yes?

GNC
Yes.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, restore CM C-4 thruster; disabled.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go EECOM.

EECOM
You've got 40 amp-hours back in battery B now.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
You got it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Okay, all flight controllers. I want to go around the horn and pick up anything you need configuration-wise. TELMU -

55:51:01
TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- you still worried about any configuration items?

TELMU
Negative. The LM heater current indicates that the LM was properly closed out. They apparently have not closed the LM hatch yet.

FLIGHT
Okay. So you're happy that you don't need them to verify that - what was it, activation 2-3, those pages we were on?

TELMU
That's right. That was TLC 2, and we're happy.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
Can we ask about the docking index again?

FLIGHT
CAPCOM will get that for me.

FLIGHT
Okay. Got your answer, GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, go with it.

55:52:31
FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you got any configuration items here?

GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, looks like the last item we need here is a stir on H₂ and O₂ at their convenience.

CAPCOM
Okay.

55:53:56
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

55:54:00
GUIDO
We finally got a ∆H update. Do you want to just read it up to the crew or uplink it?

FLIGHT
Let's see, now. Can we collapse deadbands and do all that good stuff if we uplink here?

GUIDO
Uh. Yeah. That - why don't we just read it up to them?

FLIGHT
If they enter it through the DSKY are they gonna do it?

GUIDO
Standby 1.

FLIGHT
Now, we haven't stabled out at that attitude yet, so I don't think we're gonna have any problems.

GNC
FLIGHT, I don't think there's any problem, they haven't opened up deadbands yet.

FLIGHT
Yeah, that's just what I'm saying. The time to do it is now, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
As long as he's in P00 and don't reselect it, he can uplink it - enter it himself or we can do it easier. Doesn't matter.

FLIGHT
Okay. Why don't - you gotta pass the data for the crew checklist anyway on-board, don't you?

55:55:04
GUIDO
Right.

FLIGHT
Don't you got a page update? Well, why don't we read it up to them and that'll serve both purposes.

GUIDO
Alright.

FLIGHT
Both have them enter it as well as why don't you tell them what page you want it in the checklist?

GUIDO
Okay.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

TELMU
We show the LM overhead hatch is closed, and the heater current looks normal.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
We've had a hardware restart. I don't know what it was.

FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you want to look at it? See if you see any problems?

FLIGHT
Roger. We're copying it, CAPCOM. We see a hardware restart.

FLIGHT
You see an AC BUS UNDERVOLT there, GUIDANCE? Err - EECOM?

EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
I believe the crew reported it.

CAPCOM
We've got a MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got some instrumentation funnies, let me add them up.

FLIGHT
Roger.

55:56:00
EECOM
We may have had an instrumentation problem, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Roger.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

INCO
We switched to WIDE BEAM width about the time we had the problem.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
INCO, you say you went to WIDE BEAM width there?

INCO
Yes.

FLIGHT
Let's see if we can correlate those times. Get the time when you went WIDE BEAM, INCO.

INCO
Okay.

55:57:02
CAPCOM
Do we have the floodlights off right now?

TELMU
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we can determine that from the LM current.

FLIGHT
Roger, we copy that also.

55:58:13
FLIGHT
EECOM, you see any AC problems? Looks like -

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
- we have a lot of instrumentation problems here. Go ahead.

EECOM
That's affirm. He's flipping the fuel cells around, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well, let's get some recommendation here, Sy, if you've got any better ideas.

FLIGHT
Sy, what do you want to do? Hold your own, and -

FLIGHT
- Sy, have you got a SIG SENSOR type problem there, or what?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
He's got fuel cells 1 and 3 are offline. We've got MAIN A volts, we have no MAIN B volts. Have them attempt to reconnect the fuel cells. FUEL CELL 1 to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.

55:59:02
FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
We just gotta -

FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 1 -

EECOM
- back to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 back to MAIN B.

FLIGHT
- MAIN A, 3 to MAIN B.

EECOM
Let's see what happens.

FLIGHT
Okay, now is there - do we have instrumentation problems?

EECOM
Well, we've lost - it does appear we've lost AC BUS 2 VOLTAGE. MAIN B is reading - 4 volts. And that effectively takes AC 2 away from us -

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
- the - yeah and he reported barber poles on the -

FLIGHT
Roger.

EECOM
- on the fuel cell on-board, too, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
(unintelligible) yeah.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

EECOM
Let's see if we can get our DC back.

FLIGHT
Roger. Go ahead, GNC.

GNC
Verify that the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVES are open.

FLIGHT
You seeing an attitude problem or you seeing some BI-levels that are giving you problems?

GNC
No, it's some low pressures in the fuel and oxidizer which would be symptomatic of the HELIUM VALVE closing and firing some jets.

FLIGHT
Quad number 2 HELIUM VALVE open?

56:00:01
GNC
Quad Delta.

FLIGHT
Quad Delta - HELIUM VALVE open, right?

GNC
Right.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to verify the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVE is open, please.

FLIGHT
Are there other problems in the RCS, Buck?

CAPCOM
Okay, is that all we've come up with for them; have we got any other recommendations?

FLIGHT
Yeah, we wanted to get FUEL CELL 1 configured to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B. Did you pass that up?

EECOM
Let's attempt that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
INCO, this seems to be an AC type problem, it may be tied into that high-gain thing you got.

INCO
We went to WIDE BEAM with - FLIGHT - at 55:55:04, best we can tell.

FLIGHT
Okay.

56:01:06
EECOM
I copy, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Let me commiserate on that.

CAPCOM
Is there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation or have we got a real problem, or what?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Let's reverse the configuration request -

FLIGHT
Okay, but wait a minute. We've got a good MAIN A BUS, let's make sure that whatever we do doesn't screw up MAIN A. MAIN A -

EECOM
FUEL CELL 2 is on MAIN A, FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
- and I'm not going to ask to change that.

FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do?

EECOM
Let's try to put FUEL CELL 1 on MAIN B, FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A. We'll use the other sensing circuitry.

FLIGHT
FUEL CELL number 1 on MAIN B -

56:02:00
EECOM
- FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A.

EECOM
We're not going to touch FUEL CELL 2, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, but if we got any problems in the system I want to make sure that we don't blow the voltage off MAIN A, then we're not going to be able to see anything.

FLIGHT
Can we review our status here, Sy, and see what we've got from a standpoint of status. What do you think we've got in the spacecraft that's good?

EECOM
MAIN BUS A is reading 25 volts.

FLIGHT
Okay. MAIN A -

EECOM
And that's reflected by the fact - FUEL CELL 2 is putting out 53 amps, which is just about the most it can and keep our voltage up.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
So that's bona fide. AC BUS 2 is 0, which is reflected by the fact that we lost MAIN B.

FLIGHT
AC BUS -

EECOM
Standby, FLIGHT.

56:03:03
FLIGHT
- zero output.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
Okay. If we want to keep - - standby, he's changed configuration, we've got BATTERY A on MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
That's what I was going to ask you for, to put the battery on, FLIGHT.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

INCO
We need OMNI Bravo. Our high-gain won't drive without AC 2.

FLIGHT
Okay. You want OMNI Bravo?

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
You don't think we're going to be able to get HIGH BIT RATE data here, do you? On the OMNIs.

INCO
We may be. We've got the 210s.

FLIGHT
You've got the 210s -

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay, that'll save a bit of power. CAPCOM, recommend selection of OMNI Bravo, please -

56:04:02
INCO
It's Charlie now.

FLIGHT
Okay, Charlie.

INCO
He's maneuvering.

CAPCOM
OMNI Charlie?

FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

INCO
Roger.

INCO
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got OMNI Charlie and HIGH BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
Okay. You have HIGH BIT RATE now off the 210s, right? OMNI -

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

56:05:00
EECOM
Okay. Let's get a readout on a couple of fuel cell pressures here -

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
- FUEL CELL 1 N₂ pressure. FUEL CELL 3 O₂ pressure. We're reading 0 N₂ pressure on FUEL CELL 1 and 13psi on FUEL CELL 3 O₂ pressure.

FLIGHT
Okay, you want FUEL CELL 1 -

EECOM
N₂ pressure.

FLIGHT
- N₂ pressure. FUEL CELL 3, what do you want there?

EECOM
O₂ pressure.

FLIGHT
O₂ pressure. CAPCOM, let's get those as a start.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
When his hardware restart he was doing a clearly fine maneuver, and that should have killed it, but we're still moving. We ought to stop it.

FLIGHT
Are we using RCS now, Buck?

FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

56:06:02
FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

GNC
GNC.

FLIGHT
Did you see any problems in Quad D HELIUM VALVE? Does that look like that's cleared up?

GNC
Roger, that's cleared up, FLIGHT, we're in good shape.

FLIGHT
Okay. Now, are we using RCS now?

GNC
That's affirmative, we're going to have to switch some thrusters to MAIN A to hold attitude here.

FLIGHT
Okay. How much RCS are we using?

GNC
Oh, we've used - our guess 25 pounds.

FLIGHT
Okay. Give me minimum fuel usage configuration that'll keep me attitude.

GNC
Roger.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

TELMU
The LM heater current's become essentially static.

FLIGHT
Roger. Let's solve one problem at a time. Come back to me later on on it.

56:07:05
CAPCOM
We confirming those numbers?

FLIGHT
Buck, I need that RCS stuff as soon as you can get it.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. He's turned off all jets now.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, we came up with those numbers, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, Sy. Give me your next best thing to try.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Why don't we try - leave FUEL CELL 2 alone, and just make sure that 1 and 3 are disconnected from both buses. And make sure that there's abs - that there won't be any load on them at all. And let's see what happens to those cells.

56:08:06
FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do? Open-circuit FUEL CELL 1 and 3?

EECOM
That's affirm, flight.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, let's recommend we open-circuit FUEL CELL number 1 and number 3 and leave FUEL CELL number 2 as-is.

CAPCOM
Okay, 1 and 3 open-circuit, 2 as-is. And earlier we got a report from them that 1 and 3 were reading grey but zero flow.

FLIGHT
Yeah - CAPCOM, let's amend that. EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Why don't we just open-circuit 1 and make sure we don't have any problems getting that back onto the bus -

EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- and just watch it for a while before we make any further moves with 3.

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. Let's just open-circuit one of those right now.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

56:09:05
EECOM
That's roger, FLIGHT. That's the AC problem.

FLIGHT
Roger.

FLIGHT
Crew thinks they're venting something.

EECOM
I heard it, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Copy that, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay, let's everybody think of the kinds of things that we'd be venting. GNC, you got anything that looks abnormal in your system?

GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How about you, EECOM? You see anything that - with the instrumentation you've got that could be venting?

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

56:10:01
EECOM
Let me look at the system, FLIGHT, as far as the venting is concerned.

FLIGHT
Okay. Let's start scanning. I assume you've called in your backup EECOMs?

FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
FLIGHT, say again?

FLIGHT
Have you called in your backup EECOMS now? See if we can get some more brain power on this thing?

EECOM
We got one here.

FLIGHT
Roger.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

INCO
He's - he's - never mind, he's straightening up a little bit.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. We've got the LM still attached, the LM spacecraft is good, so if we need to get back home we've got a LM to do it with. Okay? Let's make sure we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM electrical power with the batteries, or that will cause us to lose the MAIN - the FUEL CELL number 2. We want to keep the O₂ and that kind of stuff working, we'd like to have RCS. But we've got the Command Module system, so we're in good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessin'.

56:11:47
GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

GNC
I have some jet configurations for you whenever you need them.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Give them to me.

56:12:01
GNC
Okay. Charlie 3, Charlie 4 to MAIN A. Bravo 3 and Bravo 4 to MAIN A. Charlie 1 and Charlie 2 to MAIN A -

FLIGHT
Standby.

GNC
Yeah; it's all of quad Charlie on MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GNC
Plus Bravo 3 and Bravo 4.

FLIGHT
Now, what are we going to be doing with these, GNC?

GNC
That'll give us one jet in each direction on each axis.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
He's getting close to gimbal lock.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM - okay, CAPCOM, recommend he bring up C-3, C-4, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2 on MAIN A and advise him he's getting close to gimbal lock.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, from FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Could we go to a coarse align on the platform here, so we don't have to use any gas if we need to? We could reorient if necessary.

56:13:02
GUIDO
Roger. I was going to recommend a P52 in a little bit anyway -

FLIGHT
Well, it's going to take a while before we get to the point we're even thinking about a P52.

GUIDO
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Yeah, it'll coarse align itself there, won't it?

GUIDO
It'll coarse align at -

FLIGHT
Roger.

GUIDO
- any time itself.

56:14:10
FLIGHT
Okay, EECOM. I'm coming back to you.

EECOM
FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
- I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down.

FLIGHT
Okay -

EECOM
Let's go down the emergency 1-5.

FLIGHT
You want to power down, let us look at the TM and all that good stuff, and then come back up.

EECOM
That's affirm.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. OMNI Bravo.

FLIGHT
You want OMNI Bravo again?

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
On board. OMNI Bravo.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, recommend OMNI Bravo.

FLIGHT
Okay. What - you want to go to - power down - give me the page.

EECOM
Emergency 1-5, FLIGHT, we'll go down - try to get a delta of 10 amps reduction.

56:15:14
INCO
Okay, we've got OMNI Bravo, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
EECOM, do you want to go through that again? What do you want to power down to?

EECOM
I want to power down a total of 10 amps, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
A total of 10 amps.

EECOM
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we'd recommend emergency power down checklist 1-5, we want to power down a total - a delta of 10 amps from where we are now.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

GNC
Can we afford to do a PTC first, and then we can shut off all of that stuff with no problems.

FLIGHT
Why? You think you're going to have a thermal problem here?

GNC
Well, we could have - if we stay there too long, or we -

FLIGHT
Okay, we'll run into that one later, Buck -

GNC
Okay.

FLIGHT
- I want to get our major problems sorted out now.

56:16:02
CAPCOM
You want - you still want 1-5 down to 10 amps?

FLIGHT
1-5 power down a delta of 10 amps, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You don't want to get fuel cell pumps off, do you?

FLIGHT
Optics power is already off, I believe.

EECOM
We can do that on FUEL CELL number 1, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission.

56:17:20
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Would you not want to consider going to PTC?

FLIGHT
Well, why don't we get this problem here resolved, right now -

EECOM
This will aid our power down, I think -

FLIGHT
Pardon?

EECOM
- this should aid our power down, I'd hope - wouldn't it?

FLIGHT
Well, do you expect that we're going to be in a thermal problem for the next many hours? EECOM?

EECOM
Well, don't know where to say the sun is right now, FLIGHT.

GNC
Well, it's pretty close to quad A right now. Are we -

EECOM
By 90 degrees?

GNC
I don't know exactly where. It's between A and B, mostly on A.

56:18:32
FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

GNC
GNC.

FLIGHT
Buck, I'd prefer not making any unnecessary maneuvers now, or try to use any of the equipment's on board the spacecraft, such things as CMC, that type of stuff until we nail down what our problem is.

GNC
Well, that's why I was recommending PTC because we don't need any of that stuff then; heaters or anything else.

FLIGHT
Yeah, but you gotta get the CMC on, and keep it online. And you need a rather precise period of time for redamping there.

56:19:10
GNC
In the order of about 20 minutes to damp out and spin up and then we don't need any of that.

GNC
If we get a good spinup going then we're stable -

FLIGHT
Okay, that might be a good idea. That would buy us some time from a standpoint of reviewing the data. And it would get us back into the - as close to the normal flight plan as we could. How far are we out of attitude right now?

GNC
He's a fair ways out right now, FLIGHT. He'd do another VERB 49 and fly back and then stabilize there.

56:20:57
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Okay, I need one thing right now. He's powering down, he's down to 41 amps, total spacecraft. I'd like to get my AC 2 BUS back so I can look at O₂ TANK 2 PRESSURE. I have no insight into that.

56:21:12
FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
Let's get - I guess we can put INVERTER 3 to MAIN A. AC 2.

EECOM
Let's just do it temporarily -

FLIGHT
Now, let me ask you a question - before you do that would you like to make sure you've got all AC load you don't need isolated from the bus?

EECOM
Nah, it - let's not do that right now, FLIGHT. I think we're in good shape that way. The MAIN A is up high enough where it can handle the inverter.

FLIGHT
Well, the thing that concerns me is starting - is throwing equipment - we had a problem, we don't know the cause of the problem, and -

EECOM
FLIGHT, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells. I hate to put it that way, but - I don't know why we've lost them. It doesn't all tag up. And it's not an instrumentation problem, the best I can tell right now.

56:22:00
FLIGHT
Okay, I'll tell you what. Let's discuss this for just a little bit longer there, Sy. CAPCOM, start them moving back towards a PTC attitude, let's start him going into his rate damping. I feel it's going to be a relatively long period of time to try and nail down the problem. Go ahead.

CAPCOM
He's asking how do we like his amperage setup right now?

FLIGHT
Are you happy with his power level right now, EECOM?

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
I'd like to firmly secure the high-gain before he starts getting into PTC.

GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
GNC? What's firing now? You got something firing?

GNC
Well, we've seen quite a bit of thruster activity.

56:23:02
FLIGHT
Okay, I guess this kills the PTC, too, because we're not going to get into PTC as long as we've got something venting.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. That agrees with what we're seeing here.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
I've got a little correction. Let's put INVERTER 1 on both AC buses, please.

FLIGHT
INVERTER 1 on both AC.

EECOM
That's affirm, so I can get some AC BUS power back so I can have some insight into my AC BUS 2 telemetry, especially my cyros, maybe - the venting may be coming from that. And also, I think that the FUEL CELL 2 pumps are on AC 2, and this will take care of it without switching the pumps yet.

FLIGHT
Say that again. You think your fuel cell pumps -

EECOM
Yeah. FUEL CELL 2 pumps I think are on AC 2.

FLIGHT
Okay, but according to the checklist, he should have powered - he should have turned those off, right? Now, he said he was down through BMAG number 2 is in WARM UP, so he's already gone through the fuel cell pump stuff.

56:24:01
EECOM
Okay. Good enough.

FLIGHT
Okay, so you want to configure INVERTER 1 on both AC buses.

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT, I didn't - I was listening to the spacecraft and I didn't pass up INVERTER 3 to MAIN A to AC 2, did you delete that?

FLIGHT
No, we deleted that.

CAPCOM
Alright.

FLIGHT
You want to put INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. EECOM and CAPCOM, let's do it.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Monitor this bear when we switch again -

EECOM
With you.

56:25:00
FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Will you take a look at the prelaunch data and go through your systems and see if there's anything you've got that may have started venting here?

CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT.

TELMU
We'll look.

FLIGHT
Okay. And I want a report on that in about the next fifteen minutes. Quick look type stuff.

CONTROL
Okay.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

FDO
We're definitely seeing a vent in the data.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Roger. We copy that, CAPCOM.

EECOM
Fuel cell - FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
FUEL CELL 2 PUMPS to AC 1.

FLIGHT
You want FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.

EECOM
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.

56:26:02
FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Have you got anybody getting a delog on this thing downstairs?

FLIGHT
NETWORK, from FLIGHT.

NETWORK
FLIGHT, NETWORK.

FLIGHT
Bring me up another computer in the RTCC, will you?

NETWORK
We got one machine on the RTCC and we got dual CPs downstairs.

FLIGHT
Okay, I want another machine up in the RTCC and I want a bunch of guys capable of running delogs down there.

NETWORK
Roger that.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT, did you hear them say he's getting some rates? We want to know if he's firing any thrusters?

FLIGHT
Roger. GNC, watch those thrusters, will you?

GNC
GNC. Say again?

FLIGHT
Have you got any thrusters firing?

GNC
We're looking at that C-3 thruster, FLIGHT. It looks like it stays on most of the time.

FLIGHT
Well, can we turn them all off and see if we've still got the rates or any build-up in rates?

GNC
Well, the rates that we're seeing is opposite to the direction of that thruster, so if anything it's just trying to hold and not quite up to it.

FLIGHT
Okay, but -

CAPCOM
He's been trying to counteract the rates with DIRECT. He's been getting a negative pitch and a negative roll.

56:27:03
FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
But he asked if we were getting some thruster firings that were not being made by him.

FLIGHT
I'll tell you what, GNC can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure out what the equivalent ∆V is we're getting? So that we can see if we can backtrack to see if we can figure out what's venting.

FLIGHT
In other words, do - it would seem that we could equate that to effective thrust and an axis and then deduce what's venting.

GNC
Roger, we'll give that a try, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. And that might be of interest to the LM guys.

CAPCOM
He also said it was coming past window number 1.

FLIGHT
Roger, we got that.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. Need OMNI Charlie.

FLIGHT
OMNI Charlie, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT. What did - okay, we've got two good AC buses. What did all that tell you, now?

EECOM
It tells me that - well, just give me about 2 more minutes, FLIGHT.

56:28:04
FLIGHT
Okay. Take your time.

FLIGHT
Roger. Concur, CAPCOM.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU. We copy.

FLIGHT
Roger.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

FDO
Two machines in the RTCC.

56:29:00
FLIGHT
Okay.

56:31:38
GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

GNC
We would like to turn thruster Alpha 3 on MAIN A and see that'll help control that pitch and at the same time we can turn off Charlie 3 because -

FLIGHT
Okay. Get me some real-time plotting on how we're using RCS here, will you?

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. And in the pitch axis we really don't seem to be using any. And that's why we'd like to go to Alpha and see if that changes it any.

FLIGHT
Okay, now what do you want again?

56:32:00
GNC
Thruster Alpha 3 to MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Alpha 3 to MAIN A.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to pass that up to the crew, please?

FLIGHT
Give me a gross amount of RCS propellant consumed so far, GNC.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. It'll take 30 seconds.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT. We're still below the limits.

EECOM
Flight, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
We've really got to get that battery off the line and power down some more. And we've got to get some MAIN B power back so we can build our pressure back up in O₂ TANK 1. It's down to 318psi.

FLIGHT
BATTERY -

EECOM
With MAIN B down, we have no heaters in O₂ tanks.

FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to power down?

EECOM
Well, where'd he say he got down to? BMAG 2 OFF? Not inclusive?

56:33:03
FLIGHT
That's affirmative. BMAG 2 is in WARM UP.

EECOM
I think we'll go ahead and turn that down - we still have the LM with us, right?

FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

EECOM
So - if we shut down the SCS we ought to be a little better off, perhaps. I think we ought to press on and go down through BMAG 2 OFF, and get those lights minimum.

FLIGHT
Okay. How much you want to power down? Another 10 amps?

EECOM
Let's get the BMAG off and get the lights down to a minimum. Let's go down two more steps.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power down a little bit more. Want to get the BMAG off and the lights minimum there.

FLIGHT
Okay, Sy. Now, how long do you want to leave this battery online?

56:34:03
EECOM
I want to try and get it off as quick as I can -

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
- but I need to get the power down.

EECOM
The crew did report they removed FUEL CELL 3 - they open-circuited it also, didn't they?

FLIGHT
I don't believe so.

EECOM
FUEL CELL 1 and FUEL CELL 3 should be open-circuited.

CAPCOM
We just had our last call for FUEL CELL 1 open-circuit, and we left FUEL CELL 3 as it was.

EECOM
Let's take this open-circuit, FUEL CELL 3.

FLIGHT
Open-circuit FUEL CELL 3.

EECOM
Get it off the bus.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Calling, FLIGHT. Say again?

GNC
This is GNC, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GNC
Yeah, we've used a total of about 70 pounds RCS. We'd like to change the jet configurations, see if that'll help us out any.

FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to try now?

GNC
We'd like to turn the Bravo jets all to be OFF, and all Delta to MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Turn all Bravo OFF, and Delta to MAIN A, right?

GNC
Roger. That will verify that it isn't a Bravo thruster that's causing the problem with attitudes.

56:35:04
FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we'd like to turn all Bravo jets OFF and all Delta jets to MAIN A.

CAPCOM
Roger.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Let's take BATTERY A off the MAIN.

FLIGHT
We can support the -

EECOM
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
- MAIN now on the one fuel cell even with the cryo O₂ going down?

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. What's your worry level on cryo O₂?

EECOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Okay. You want to -

EECOM
I want to save the battery, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Let's see, what battery have we got online, Sy?

EECOM
Say again?

FLIGHT
What battery have we got online?

EECOM
BATTERY Alpha, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
BATTERY A, okay.

EECOM
And next step, of course, we'll then think - we've got to worry about getting some power on MAIN B to get the pressure back up in O₂ TANK 1.

FLIGHT
Roger. Turn BATTERY A OFF, CAPCOM.

56:36:15
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Let's have them isolate the surge tank also, and save it. We'll use the cryo as much as we can.

FLIGHT
Say that again?

EECOM
Let's isolate the surge tanks -

FLIGHT
Why that?

EECOM
- in the Command Module.

FLIGHT
I don't understand that, Sy.

EECOM
I don't want to - I want to use the cryo as much as possible.

FLIGHT
But that would seem to be the opposite, if you want to keep the fuel cell going.

EECOM
The fuel cells are fed off the tanks in the Service Module, FLIGHT. The surge tank is in the Command Module. We want to save the surge tank and use it for re-entry.

FLIGHT
Okay, I'm with you. I'm with you.

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's also isolate the surge tank.

CAPCOM
Okay, you want to isolate the surge tank.

56:37:00
FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
O₂ surge tank, right?

FLIGHT
Yeah. What we're really doing is securing our entry systems right now.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we're trying to figure out some way to get power on BUS B.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

56:38:10
FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Did you consider putting a battery on BUS B long enough to get the pressure up?

EECOM
Well, I'm trying - I want to determine whether or not the - the 5 amps is going to hurt us any. That's going to be on MAIN A, incidentally. I made a mistake. O₂ TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Well, we've got MAIN A with us, haven't we?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
Okay. Since O₂ TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A, and we've got them off now, we'll be able to stand the 5 amps temporarily for manual pressurization. Let's have them turn the heaters on manually in O₂ TANK 1.

56:39:03
FLIGHT
O₂ -

EECOM
And we'll watch the pressure.

FLIGHT
- TANK 1.

EECOM
That's CRYOGENIC O₂ HEATER 1, FLIGHT.

GNC
FLIGHT, we copy that. No problem.

FLIGHT
No problem, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we want to get CRYO O₂ TANK number 1 HEATER ON.

FLIGHT
You can stand the 5 amps on MAIN A?

EECOM
That's affirm. We think so, FLIGHT.

56:40:07
FLIGHT
Did you see your 5 amp increase in current there, EECOM?

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
26.7 volts, looks good -

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
 - we'll watch the pressure.

EECOM
FLIGHT, to be consistent we ought to isolate the REPRESS package also.

FLIGHT
Okay, you want to isolate REPRESS pack.

FLIGHT
AFD, from FLIGHT.

AFD
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Get one of your guys full-time in the back room keeping track of the spacecraft configuration as we pass it up to the crew. You might use Larry. Why don't you stay on, get Larry in the back room to keep track of configuration stuff we give to the crew?

AFD
Okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay?

AFD
And we've got the voice recorder and we're starting to transcribe that.

56:41:01
FLIGHT
Okay, now has anybody started the delog of the initial problem? You've got a delog going? Have you got people that are going to be in a position to evaluate it?

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Roger. I want LM manning around the clock.

CONTROL
Roger.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
I want the fans on in O₂ tank 1, we're not seeing a pressure increase. We can stand it.

FLIGHT
You can stand it?

EECOM
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
Fans on in TANK 1, right?

EECOM
Affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to bring the fans on in TANK 1?

EECOM
It's just 1 amp, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
Okay, he's got an MC&W for - varied reasons.

56:42:20
GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, GNC.

GNC
It looks like the vehicle has stabilized considerably over the last few minutes.

FLIGHT
Okay. That could mean one of two things. Either whatever was venting has stopped venting, it's empty; or do you feel it could also be associated with the thruster Quad Bravo we just isolated?

GNC
It's possible, FLIGHT. We really don't know yet, though.

FLIGHT
Okay. Are we essentially in a - can you figure out what orientation we are from a standpoint of thermal control? Assume - what's our rate right now?

GNC
Right now he has a -0.10 of a degree in pitch. And yaw and roll are very close to 0.

56:43:01
FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
The pressure in O₂ TANK 1 is all the way down to 297, we'd better think about getting in the LM, or using the LM systems. I'm going to have to power way down; I don't know if I'm going to be able to save the O₂ for the third fuel cell - for FUEL CELL 2, rather.

FLIGHT
The heaters aren't working, now let's start thinking circuit breakers. You got any circuit breakers you want to check, there?

EECOM
We saw the current, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You saw the current - okay, look -

EECOM
Let's check it anyway, FLIGHT, you're right.

FLIGHT
It looks like it's cycling up a PCM count from 297 to 302. Give me some circuit breakers to check.

EECOM
Okay, panel 226. CRYOGENIC O₂ HEATER 1, MAIN A circuit breaker.

FLIGHT
I'm sorry, I didn't catch you there. CRYO O₂ TANK 1? Panel 226?

EECOM
CYRO O₂ HEATER 1, MAIN A, panel 226.

FLIGHT
Roger.

EECOM
Also, FLIGHT, let's check the FAN MOTOR circuit breakers TANK 1, on panel 226 also.

56:44:08
FLIGHT
FAN MOTOR.

EECOM
CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1. There are three circuit breakers - three phase.

FLIGHT
Get that, CAPCOM?

CAPCOM
I've got the 226 CRYO O₂ HEATER 1 MAIN A, and CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1, three of them on -

FLIGHT
That's right. All three phases.

FLIGHT
EECOM, I don't think we're going to come to any solution here until we get back to the initial set of conditions, so I hope you got a set of guys looking at the delog pretty soon.

FLIGHT
TELMU, from FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LM to sustain life.

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay.

56:45:17
CAPCOM
We got the circuit breakers. All in, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Roger. Copy, all circuit breakers in.

56:46:15
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
Don't we have both BMAGs OFF?

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, would you verify that both BMAGs are OFF, please?

FLIGHT
You want to bring it off, right EECOM?

EECOM
Affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's get it off.

56:47:32
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Will you get a cockpit panel 1, 2 layout and have the crew - just get the thing and have the crew read across all instruments, all gauges, and write down exactly what they read in those things?

CAPCOM
Okay. You want a survey of panels 1 and 2 on gauges? 

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Okay. And talkbacks, huh?

FLIGHT
That's affirmative. Figure out some code that you can use and - I think that's something we should have gotten started a while ago.

56:48:10
FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
See that juice is still going down there, EECOM. You got any more suggestions?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Any more suggestions in trying to pump up O₂ TANK 1 pressure?

EECOM
No. FLIGHT, we're gonna hit 100psi in 1 hour and 54 minutes. That's the end, right there.

FLIGHT
Okay, 100psi -

EECOM
Less than 2 hours, now.

56:50:56
FLIGHT
FDO, from FLIGHT.

FDO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Whatever planning you do, I want to do assuming that we're going around the Moon and we're using the LM for performing maneuvers, because in the present configuration, unless we get a heckuva lot smarter I think we're wasting our time planning and using the SPS.

56:51:13
FDO
Okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
So I think all of our return-to-Earth type planning should be assuming the use of the LM DPS and/or RCS. And I think third priority down the line should be CSM RCS.

FDO
Okay, and I'm assuming that you want fast-as-possible return.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I think that's the case.

FDO
Okay. We'll work on it from that sideline, FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
Okay.

FDO
Should be no problem.

GUIDO
I copy that, FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
Okay, listen. There is a possibility that we blew a O₂ line in one of the fuel cells, and it's effectively manifolded there, of course. Now, I'm - I want to shut off one of the reactant valves to one of the fuel cells. And that would be FUEL CELL 3, since its O₂ pressure is gone. Now, FUEL CELL 1's O₂ pressure is trying to stay up there, at 45psi. Maybe the problem is in FUEL CELL 3.

56:52:24
FLIGHT
That sounds like a good assumption, right there.

EECOM
Yeah. FUEL CELL 3 is lost anyways, FLIGHT.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, GNC.

GNC
Turn Charlie 1 thruster OFF.

FLIGHT
You want to turn Charlie 1 OFF? Why?

GNC
Well, looks like we're getting a lot of firing out for no reason.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM, recommend THRUSTER C-1 to OFF.

CAPCOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
THRUSTER C-1 to OFF.

56:53:00
CAPCOM
C-1 and -2 OFF.

FLIGHT
No. C-1. OFF. I added a word in there. Turn THRUSTER C-1 OFF.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Why don't you show me where you think that problem is?

EECOM
Okay. Clint's coming up.

56:55:16
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
We need to get the - make sure the inline heaters for FUEL CELLS 1 and 3 are OFF.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You want to shut off both reactant valves to FUEL CELL number 3?

EECOM
It's dead anyway, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
And the inline heaters OFF in FUEL CELLS 1 and 3, please.

56:56:00
FLIGHT
What we're proposing here - supposing here, CAPCOM, is we may have a - had some problem in FUEL CELL number 3 since that's the one that's reading no O₂ right now. And we may be losing our O₂ through FUEL CELL number 3, the O₂ manifold - inasmuch as they're manifolded together commonly. Looks like the O₂ in FUEL CELL 1 and 2 seem to be trying to stay up there. And FUEL CELL 3 looks like it's the oddball here.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's close the REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.

CAPCOM
Okay, close REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.

CAPCOM
And you're saying that 1 and 2 look okay?

FLIGHT
Well, what it looks like - looks like the pressure's trying to stay up there and this is the best guess we've got right now because we've got to stop this O₂ flow.

56:57:04
CAPCOM
Okay.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
GO, GNC.

GNC
Some more jet reconfigurations to see if we can hold the attitude.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GNC
We'd like to turn Charlie 2 OFF -

FLIGHT
Wait, why are we interested in holding attitude? If we're not venting why not drift for a while? That would probably be better from a standpoint of thermal control anyway, wouldn't it?

GNC
I'd think we'd like to get into a controlled drift rather than just some random thing, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Standby.

FLIGHT
Do you want them to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown, Sy? I assume you do - heaters and all?

56:58:01
FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT. He's gone through much of it already, got the pumps off.

FLIGHT
Okay. You want them to go through the whole fuel cell shutdown. Heaters and all.

EECOM
Heaters, reactant valves, and the pumps of course he's already done.

FLIGHT
Okay. Have them go ahead, CAPCOM.

EECOM
And get the inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1 also, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1.

EECOM
Roger, it'll cut the current requirement down, anyway.

CAPCOM
The COMM holding up? Sounds like he's going out.

FLIGHT
How you doing there, INCO? From a standpoint of OMNI-switching?

56:59:02
INCO
We might be a little better on Bravo.

FLIGHT
Okay. Can you figure me out some way to keep communications and yet cut down a bit on the load? You might talk to EECOM on it.

INCO
Okay. We can turn the tape recorder OFF.

FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
You don't need the tape recorder, do you?

EECOM
Heck, no. Get it off.

FLIGHT
Let's get it off.

INCO
It may be already off, but that's one thing we don't need.

EECOM
Let's go down the list as much of that INCO stuff as we can get, FLIGHT. I think that's about the one biggie right there.

INCO
Is that the only thing we can give up? We turn the POWER AMPL OFF, we won't get HIGH BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go.

FLIGHT
Let's also verify tape recorders OFF, please.

CAPCOM
Okay, I think we -

FLIGHT
I don't think we got down that far on the list, did we? We went through the BMAGs and that was lights - BMAGs and lights, and I think we stopped right there.

CAPCOM
Yeah.

EECOM
Yeah, that's affirm, FLIGHT. Tape record - we'll skip a step and go tape recorder OFF.

57:00:12
RECOVERY
AFD, meet RECOVERY. RECOVERY loop.

FLIGHT
What was that, CAPCOM?

GUIDO
We copy, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What was that, GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
He had an 06 18 he couldn't get rid of; he's got rid of it now.

57:01:04
FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. I had them reading off a lot of gauge readings, and we got over to FUEL CELL 3. And I hope your people were copying all this down.

FLIGHT
Did you get some kind of master? We got it on tape, I'm sure we can get it off the tape.

CAPCOM
Alright. That's affirm. I'd say I have 95% of the ones he read.

FLIGHT
Okay.

57:02:18
FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

FDO
When the systems men can stand it, I need two minutes for a checkpoint to save all this data.

FLIGHT
I don't see why we couldn't - EECOM, GNC, can you stand a checkpoint right now?

EECOM
It only takes a minute, I guess I'll have to if we need it, FLIGHT.

GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I think it'd be good to get a checkpoint. Go ahead.

FLIGHT
EECOM, have you deduced anything - have you seen your REACTANT VALVES go off? You seen flow cease?

EECOM
Can't tell, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

EECOM
They were open-circuited, and the pressure - still appears to be going down.

FLIGHT
Yup.

57:03:27
FDO
Negative, FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

EECOM
We'd better confirm that the FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT VALVE circuit breaker on panel 226 was closed when he shut those.

FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT circuit breaker on what panel?

EECOM
226.

EECOM
They're normally open.

FLIGHT
Okay, good idea.

57:04:00
CAPCOM
You want them - close the circuit breaker -

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
- on the valve, and then -

FLIGHT
Yeah.

EECOM
Yeah, FLIGHT; he should have gotten a barber pole on that.

FLIGHT
Yeah, wouldn't he get a barber pole when he turned the reactants off? EECOM?

EECOM
Affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Even with the circuit breaker open?

EECOM
No -

FLIGHT
No. Okay, so he ought to know that. We can just verify that he got a -

FDO
Okay, FLIGHT. We have our checkpoint.

FLIGHT
Okay. All flight controllers, I'd suggest you start handing over, because I think a fresh team's probably going to be thinking clearer. I think the rest of us can continue working in some other function in support of the new team coming on.

GNC
Go on thruster A-4, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Go on thruster A-4, CAPCOM.

INCO
OMNI Charlie, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Roger. And OMNI Charlie.

57:06:13
FLIGHT
Okay. All flight controllers, I'm handing over to Glynn. I assume the majority of all the team guys are pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can. Now what I'd suggest is the white team do two things: they go over the delogs - okay - let me go back over this again. We're handing over to Glynn. I'd suggest the white team goes back and starts going through the delog of the data. In other words, let's see if we can go back to the initial conditions and work on that problem to see if we can find out what happened and we may find some better clues as to what to do and let the fresh guys come on and try to figure out where do we go from here.

FLIGHT
And the delog is in way now. Roger.

57:07:14
FLIGHT
Okay, EECOM. Tell me about the latch. Do you think you've got the reactants latched?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
The crew reported he got barber pole whenever he threw the reactant switch, so that implies that he did all the right things and he really got it shut off. And it looks like that didn't help us any - the pressure's not improving any.

FLIGHT
Okay, now the next question is: are you willing to do that on FUEL CELL number 1?

EECOM
That's the question we're pondering, FLIGHT. We've got to come up with an answer on that one.

FLIGHT
Soon. FUEL CELL 2 is working okay.

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Unless we do something to get that oxygen, it's not going to do us any good to save fuel cells.

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Okay - okay. GNC, FLIGHT.

57:08:01
GNC
GNC.

FLIGHT
You stabilized now? - standby.

FLIGHT
Here comes configuration, I think it's yours.

FLIGHT
I didn't copy all those; did you, GNC?

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We concur.

FLIGHT
Is that good? How are the rates?

CAPCOM
You copy those, GNC?

GNC
It's holding down around a tenth of a degree per second, FLIGHT. Isolating, he's in ACCEL CMD, so -

FLIGHT
ACCEL CMD?

GNC
Right.

FLIGHT
Alright.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT, did you copy all those thrusters?

FLIGHT
Go ahead. Who's calling?

57:09:02
CAPCOM
CAPCOM. Did you copy all those -

FLIGHT
I didn't copy them all, Jack. GNC, did you copy them all?

GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you like that configuration for right now?

GNC
Yes.

FLIGHT
As best you can tell - best you can tell, the rates are okay. And he's flying ACCEL CMD.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No rate damping, then, right?

GNC
Roger.

FLIGHT
Are both BMAG packages off?

GNC
Yes, they are.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Standby. EECOM, you need anything?

EECOM
Roger, FLIGHT. We'll take those.

CAPCOM
We want those?

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
What do you want?

EECOM
Get him to go through the meters -

57:10:00
FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
- on FUEL CELL 1 and 3.

FLIGHT
Okay. Just FUEL CELL 1 and 3, Jack.

57:11:25
FLIGHT
EECOM, I don't like the way that O₂ pressure's going down. If you want to do something about these other reactant valves, let's make up our mind.

EECOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
Don't you think?

EECOM
Let me get that for you in a minute, FLIGHT. Let's standby on these readouts.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. Anybody can copy the readouts. Be sure you're discussing these reactants.

CAPCOM
Hey, FLIGHT. CAPCOM. Long time ago I heard someone mention something about closing the REPRESS package and then we never made a decision on that. Do you want to do that, too?

57:12:03
FLIGHT
EECOM? - he's busy.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you want to close out the REPRESS pack? I think that came on for them before.

EECOM
We indicated earlier that we'd like to get it closed off -

FLIGHT
Yes, Jack.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Okay, on the reactants for FUEL CELL 1. Seems to me we have no choice but to go ahead and do it. The pressure continues to drop. We're not going to have anything left soon anyway. So, looks like the next best thing to try is to go ahead and turn the reactants OFF on FUEL CELL 1.

FLIGHT
Yeah. What is this pounds on your display, Clint?

EECOM
On O₂?

FLIGHT
Yup.

EECOM
That's - that's invalid.

FLIGHT
Okay.

EECOM
And of course, you'll want to make sure that his circuit breaker is closed for FUEL CELL 1 when he starts to close the reactant valves.

57:13:04
FLIGHT
Which circuit breaker is that? The one on 226?

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
That's FUEL CELL number 1.

EECOM
That's right, FUEL CELL reactants number 1.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
Is he done with that readout yet?

EECOM
I didn't copy the last part of it there, FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is there any chance that I'm just looking at a bad pressure reading here? I'm going to shut off the second fuel cell now, is there any data you can correlate that says that yeah, that pressure is going down?

EECOM
On the O₂ tank?

FLIGHT
Yes.

FLIGHT
You understand my question?

EECOM
I understand your question. The temperatures are also dropping. Let me get a verification on that - standby just a minute.

57:14:00
FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we copy that. Tell them we're debating shutting off the reactants on 1.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
The temperature is the only thing we have.

FLIGHT
And does it correlate?

EECOM
Pretty closely.

FLIGHT
You're saying that I'm looking at a valid pressure in that tank, and it's still going down.

EECOM
That's the way it looks, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Therefore?

EECOM
Therefore we need to go to FUEL CELL 1 and turn off the reactants.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 1 reactants. Circuit breaker and a switch.

CAPCOM
Okay - you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?

FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Do you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Yes, Jack.

CAPCOM
Because -

FLIGHT
Because the tank 1 is still going down. Pressure and temp - pressure going down, temperature confirms it.

CAPCOM
Okay.

57:15:05
FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Of course, you want to ask yourself if you want to open 3.

EECOM
Open 3?

FLIGHT
Yeah. You don't want to do that?

EECOM
Negative, let's leave 3 like it is.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Standby.

FLIGHT
What MAIN BUS do you want up?

EECOM
MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Just like we -

EECOM
Just like it is.

FLIGHT
Just like it is. FUEL CELL 2's on MAIN A.

EECOM
That's affirm.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go.

INCO
OMNI Bravo.

FLIGHT
OMNI Bravo, too, Jack.

57:16:01
FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How long can I leave that stuff off and still turn it back on? Any time at all?

EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT. It's like it wipes it out.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
I don't know. That's what I'm asking, but we've got that shut off now.

FLIGHT
Okay. When you can.

57:17:07
EECOM
That's right, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You're ready for that now. Sure, absolutely, huh EECOM?

EECOM
That's it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
It's still going down and it's not possible that thing is sort of bottoming out, is it?

EECOM
Well, the rate is slower but we have a little less pressure too, so we would expect it to be a little bit slower.

FLIGHT
You are sure, then; you want to close it.

EECOM
Seems to me we have no choice, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well.

EECOM
Standby one minute; I'll poll my back room.

FLIGHT
It went down again. One more.

EECOM
We're go on that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. That's your best judgement; we think we ought to close that off, huh?

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
It's dropping down to 234. Yeah. Okay. FUEL CELL number 1 REACTANTS coming OFF.

57:18:20
GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GNC
I think we can help the CMP a bit if we can tell them to enable B/D ROLL in the DAP. He's got A/C turned OFF and he's got A/C selected in the DAP. Can we tell him to -

FLIGHT
Is he under DAP control?

GNC
Well, he goes to it occasionally -

FLIGHT
Okay.

GNC
- he's in - RATE CMD right - ACCEL CMD right now, but -

FLIGHT
Okay. Okay. He's got A/C off, huh?

GNC
Right.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, when you get a spare minute there, Jack needs to enable B/D ROLL in the DAP if he wants to use it.

FLIGHT
If he wants to use the DAP, that is.

FLIGHT
Jeez, it's really going down.

57:19:18
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
Okay, is the - LM gotten all set up for using LM systems for supporting the CSM?

TELMU
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Yes.

EECOM
Okay. We'll get you time as to what it looks like we'll have for power here, shortly.

FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
CONTROL here.

FLIGHT
Keep reminding me of that heater; now I don't want to let that thing go too long.

CONTROL
Okay. We're still trying to get some data - substantiating data on that, FLIGHT. My own personal opinion is the sooner we can take care of that, the better off I'm going to feel about it.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay, Hal. Go get 'em.

TELMU
Okay; and FLIGHT, TELMU. We're working on a procedure right now that powers the LM internally from its own power.

FLIGHT
Yes. Fine.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go.

INCO
Save you a little more power to turn the HIGH GAIN antenna switch to OFF.

57:20:03
FLIGHT
HIGH GAIN antenna OFF?

INCO
POWER switch OFF.

FLIGHT
POWER switch. You're doing okay on the OMNIs, huh?

INCO
Yes. We've got the 210s.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, he can turn the HIGH GAIN antenna POWER switch OFF; we're doing fine on the OMNIs. We've got the big dish.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
Let's charge BATTERY A.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I was wondering about that. Do you - let me get the HIGH GAIN POWER off first, okay? Clint?

EECOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
How much - how many amps will that give us, EECOM?

EECOM
About 1.3, 1.4 amps - - amp-hours per hour. The cost is about 4.5 amps.

FLIGHT
So it's no big deal on the amps.

EECOM
That's right. And we'd like to use whatever time we have to put energy back into the battery.

FLIGHT
Yeah, and I see O₂ tank 1 pressure is 217.

EECOM
That's affirmative. It's still coming down.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT - standby.

57:21:08
FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, you want anything done with the CMC right now?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, we would like a VERB 74 before they power it down.

FLIGHT
VERB 74, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
You ready for it now?

GUIDO
Standby, FLIGHT, let me the flight - site configured.

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Does the temperature in tank 2 correspond with the pressure reading?

EECOM
Let me see how close it is, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE -

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
- we're ready.

FLIGHT
Yeah; VERB 74 you want?

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
VERB 74.

57:22:00
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
Temperature and pressure correspond - they verify that the pressure reading's right.

FLIGHT
In tank 2?

EECOM
In tank - standby.

EECOM
That's right, FLIGHT. Tank 2.

FLIGHT
Okay. Now, is it possible that we still have that tank and it's good? And we could somehow get power on B and use it?

EECOM
It's not likely, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What's not likely, Clint?

EECOM
Not likely to be able to - actually have anything left in the tank.

FLIGHT
You don't think so?

EECOM
I don't think so, but let's - we'll pulse (??) that one to you.

FLIGHT
Alright.

EECOM
Let me get you a time it looks like we've got on tank 1 here.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is there anything simple that we can refer the crew to to get them thinking about using the LM here? Have you got anything - checklist, paperwork that'll describe to them what your intentions are?

57:23:12
TELMU
Negative, there's nothing documented in contingency. We're thinking about using the LM as a lifeboat, we have some procedures here. On the ground, though.

FLIGHT
I'm sure you do. What do they amount to? Flying with the tunnel open?

TELMU
Roger. Just a LM, low power - low - supplying power to the CSM.

FLIGHT
Supplying power to the CSM?

TELMU
Yes; about 5 amps.

FLIGHT
To what?

TELMU
To their MAIN BUS B.

FLIGHT
Okay. Where did - well, MAIN B is in bad shape. We don't have anything on MAIN B right now. What's that power for? TELMU?

TELMU
Just anything they might need it for.

FLIGHT
GNC and EECOM?

GNC
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What power do you need from the LM?

EECOM
Okay, we'll -

57:24:01
FLIGHT
That's right.

EECOM
We confirm that here.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. Looks like we've got about 40 minutes left in that tank.

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Yes.

EECOM
Like to get battery A on charge, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Now -

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, just for his information we're not going to do a DPS burn until we hook around the Moon. Let them know that. And that's at about 79 +30.

57:25:24
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We didn't get a good recording on that VERB 74, we'll need them to do it again.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
We'd like to get BATTERY A on charge, and we'd like to go ahead and get some more power off if we can. I'm not sure what the situation is on getting the computer up -

FLIGHT
Clint, let me ask you now, is there anything you want to do - trying to pump up the other tank? Anything? Are you satisfied that both of these tanks are going down and we're past helping them? Even with batteries? That's what I'm getting at.

FLIGHT
I'm trying to be sure that you're satisfied that there's nothing else we can do.

EECOM
About all we can do is power down and let heat leak help us some - which is probably going to be trivial.

57:26:03
FLIGHT
Okay. There's nothing else you want to try.

FLIGHT
That's the only reason I'm delaying on this BATTERY A charge, Clint; to be sure you've gone through everything and you don't have any other tricks up your sleeve.

EECOM
Sure don't, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, what are other power do you want to take off before we start the charge?

EECOM
Well, looks like we're going to get into the control area. Whatever they can give up we'll have to come up with, here.

FLIGHT
Okay, are you ready to go ahead and charge BATTERY A?

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, why don't they get all they can in BATTERY A?

CAPCOM
Okay, and Jack also asked me if we wanted to get a P52 and get the LM platform up with the -

FLIGHT
What do you think of that? GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CONTROL. Question is, do you want to do a quick P52 on the CSM so that we can do an align to the LM? I don't know if we want to keep that LM platform up all that time anyway.

CONTROL
That's too much power in my mind, FLIGHT, to keep that thing running for all that time.

FLIGHT
Okay, therefore you don't -

CONTROL
My vote is not to do that.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

GUIDO
Mine, too.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM, we don't see any need in doing that, because we wouldn't be using the LM platform until about 79 hours.

57:27:03
CAPCOM
Okay, you don't want to worry about the LM platform. We'll align it later with the AOT, huh?

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Did you say BATTERY A charge?

CAPCOM
Yup.

FLIGHT
Okay. EECOM, we charging A? Watch it, there, okay?

EECOM
I'm watching; it's fine.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Go one more time around that room. We're letting this thing go down, although I realize we don't have any more thoughts to do, but I want to be sure that if there's anything we can do here, that we're doing it. To keep your -

57:28:04
EECOM
Just power down, FLIGHT. All we can power down will put us in that much better configuration.

FLIGHT
Okay, I got that part but are there any other things that you can do besides that, is what I'm getting at?

EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, can you help EECOM there as to what else you might power down, if anything? I don't know whether you can or not.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We'll work on that, although we're in an ATTITUDE HOLD situation here, and I'd hate to give up the CMC and the IMU right now.

FLIGHT
Yeah, well the CMC doesn't matter.

GNC
Okay, we'll work on it, FLIGHT.

EECOM
FLIGHT, we're not going to have anything in about 40 minutes here.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Okay, we've got an update on the time. Looks like we've got about 18 minutes until we get down to 100psi, and that's the cutoff point.

57:29:05
FLIGHT
Alright. But we're charging BATTERY A.

EECOM
Well, that doesn't mean much in 18 minutes, though. But we're doing all we can do.

FLIGHT
Alright. CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time.

GUIDO
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Will it do any good at all to - TELMU, FLIGHT -

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- join in here. The question is, should we try to do a quick align with the CSM and do an alignment in the LM? Can we keep an alignment in the LM up until 79 hours? Can you keep that kind of power on?

TELMU
Standby.

FLIGHT
The pilots are reporting it's difficult to do that alignment from scratch in the LM docked.

FLIGHT
And we get a tradeoff here as to whether we can stand that kind of power.

TELMU
Standby 1, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Alright. Pronto.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC. We'd save a little power if we turn all the jets off in QUAD C. We're pulsing those jets and we suspect that we've - closed the PROP ISOL VALVES in QUAD C so it's doing us no good right now, so we need to turn off all the jets in the quad.

57:30:14
FLIGHT
Oh, okay, RCS SELECT -

GNC
Right.

FLIGHT
RCS SELECT ?? check.

FLIGHT
EECOM? Any need to dump water?

EECOM
Negative on that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No sweat there, Jack.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
They get the POWER AMPL off? I heard them talking about it a while ago. I don't know.

INCO
No, they don't.

EECOM
We can eliminate that central in the 85 foot gainway.

INCO
That's not exactly true -

EECOM
Okay.

INCO
We're looking at it to see how far down we can go.

57:31:02
FLIGHT
Alright.

EECOM
I believe GNC has got some things we can turn down here.

FLIGHT
Yeah, he just - AUTO RCS in Quad Charlie can go off; we've got that Quad PROP ISOL'd. Which I didn't know, but.

EECOM
Pardon?

FLIGHT
Quad Charlie AUTO RCS - GNC, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GNC, FLIGHT.

GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Confirm: Quad Charlie is PROP ISOL'd off, right?

GNC
Well, we haven't confirmed that, FLIGHT, but it appears that that's the situation we're in. The shock of the O₂ thing, it probably closed those valves -

FLIGHT
Oh, you think -

GNC
- and we haven't been able to open them because those are powered off of MAIN B.

FLIGHT
Mm. Okay.

GNC
But A appears to be working okay.

FLIGHT
Okay. We think Quad Charlie's PROP ISOL'd off, Jack, so in that case we ought to turn off the AUTO RCS SELECT; that'll save a little power. Probably not much.

CAPCOM
Yeah - you want AUTO RCS OFF on Charlie?

FLIGHT
Uh huh.

CAPCOM
How about antennas? How are we doing? Did I hear them give me some bad COMM there?

57:32:02
INCO
We're in pretty good shape right now, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Let me try one more time. Is it possible that if we got power to MAIN B that we could get TANK 2 powered up and up the pressure?

EECOM
We don't feel like that's a possibility, FLIGHT. We might conceivably get power to B but we don't feel like we can get anything out of TANK 2.

FLIGHT
Okay, now why is that? Tell me why.

EECOM
It's because the numbers we're looking at indicate that it's essentially ambient.

FLIGHT
Hold on.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
GNC, watch we don't pick up any rates now, will you please?

GNC
Okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How long have we got now in the cell?

EECOM
Last account we had 18 minutes, let me get an update.

FLIGHT
Okay. TELMU, what have we got to do to power up to get some COMM on the LM?

57:33:02
TELMU
Okay FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here that gets power up first on the LM.

FLIGHT
Yeah. EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, that gets us power but what do you want up? Just the COMM?

EECOM
We'll have to have an environment for the crew, the way this can be -

FLIGHT
That's what I'm asking you, EECOM and TELMU. We've got to figure out how - we're just about out of CSM talkin'.

TELMU
Okay.

FLIGHT
What do you want them to power up in the LM?

TELMU
Standby 1.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM -

FLIGHT
Alright.

EECOM
- out input is, here, that we'll have to live out at the LM.

FLIGHT
I understand.

EECOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
We've got a power up procedure here from TELMU but we've got to start thinking about what you want pow - configured in the ECS and the COMM.

57:34:01
EECOM
Right.

TELMU
That gets power in the LM, and then we'll get you some COMM and TM here.

FLIGHT
Yeah - do we need to send any power to the CSM? For the platform, or anything? Or, can we even do that?

EECOM
I'm not sure we can do that yet.

FLIGHT
Can't do that.

FLIGHT
That was a long time ago.

CAPCOM
Okay. When do you want them to start working on this procedure?

FLIGHT
Well, tell them they gotta start thinking about the power - going over and powering right now because they're going to have lights problem in a little while in the CSM.

CAPCOM
Okay, I'll send it up. And they wanted to know if we wanted them to try to reset the PROPELLANT VALVES in the secondaries.

GNC
Yeah, roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GNC?

GNC
That won't do any good because we lost MAIN B and those valves are powered off of B.

FLIGHT
No - no, CAPCOM. It's off MAIN B.

57:35:34
FLIGHT
EE - TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Does this title - this PG&E (??) page - mean anything more than just power up the LM?

TELMU
No. That's all.

FLIGHT
Alright.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
We'd like to go ahead and power down the CSM all we can except leave that battery charger on. Of course, leave a little light because we're going to be there in 15 minutes anyway.

57:36:03
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we're going to out of power in the CSM in 15 minutes in the fuel cells. We want them to start getting the tunnel clear and get ready and get over there and power up the LM as soon as they can, they ought to send somebody over there. EECOM, what ought they do to leave the cockpit?

EECOM
Say again?

FLIGHT
EECOM and GNC. What ought we do to leave the CSM cockpit? We're going to lose power on the buses, now what do you want to switch off?

EECOM
Power it down, FLIGHT. All of it.

GNC
The CMC and the IMU, mainly, FLIGHT.

57:38:24
FLIGHT (off loop)
That's the problem.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Last ditch stand on O₂ tank 2, let's turn the fans on.

EECOM
That'll cost about 1 amp.

FLIGHT
What are they off? MAIN A?

EECOM
They're on AC.

FLIGHT
Okay. Fans in tank 2 ON.

EECOM
Fans, tank 2, ON.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

57:39:02
FLIGHT
Tell them to try the fans in tank 2. They're off the AC and last ditch stand we'll try the fans in tank 2. Turn the fans on in TANK 2, it only takes 1 amp.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
TELMU, GUIDANCE, and CONTROL; FLIGHT.

CONTROL
CONTROL, here.

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you know status of the CSM platform right now?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. It's - good as far as we know.

FLIGHT
No, no, no. Do you know its orientation? Do you know its orientation?

GUIDO
It's PTC REFSMMAT.

FLIGHT
Yeah. You know what you've got, and so okay.

FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Did he get it? Fans 2 ON?

EECOM
We can't tell, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
He got it, did he, Jack? Number 2 fans?

CAPCOM (off loop)
He said he got it.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, CONTROL, and TELMU. The point is, should we, quick - if you guys can't run out the power steady, run out - align the - your IMU to the CSM while we study the problem? See what we got in the way of power?

57:40:13
FLIGHT
Tom Stafford is concerned that they'll have a hell of a time getting the platform aligned in the LM with AOT.

GUIDO
I agree, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
I agree, too, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. What's should we tell them to do?

CONTROL
It's going to take about 15, 20 minutes as I understand it to do that procedure, that right GUIDANCE?

FLIGHT
Which procedure?

GUIDO
The docked alignment -

CONTROL
Docked align.

CAPCOM
How about you give me an Activation page?

FLIGHT
How about - a -

GUIDO
Well, how long does it take to -

FLIGHT
- how about a coarse align? At least you get - at least you start in -

GUIDO
Okay, that's in the ballpark, FLIGHT; that's correct.

FLIGHT
Okay, now. What do you - what do we do to get this done? EECOM, you got all my power in the LM with that procedure? What power have you got on the LM?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We ought to go ahead and go a P52 first in the CSM and get -

FLIGHT
That's what I'm asking you -

GUIDO
- a reference. Right -

FLIGHT
- do you know? Well, do you have one now? We don't have much time! Do you have a good one now? As far as you know?

GUIDO
A good alignment?

FLIGHT
Yeah, that's what I'm asking! Do you have a good alignment?

57:41:01
GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
I'm not worried about the tenths of a degree, either.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

GUIDO
Well, it ought to be that good, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. So we don't need to do a P52 -

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Okay, we need to open up the surge tank. The manifold pressure is dropping.

FLIGHT
Uh - okay. Wouldn't you rather power that from the LM - pump that up from the LM?

EECOM
Well, we - - we've got to get into the LM first, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, get them going in the LM. We've got to get the oxygen on in the LM.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
Okay, we have a procedure here. Probably the easiest thing is to refer them to Activation -

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

TELMU
- 11 and Activation 12.

FLIGHT
What will that do for us?

TELMU
That gives them the COMM -

FLIGHT
Okay, Activation 11 -

57:42:00
TELMU
And 12.

FLIGHT
- and 12. 

TELMU
13, step 1.

FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, Jack?

TELMU
And cross out the VHF stuff.

FLIGHT
Okay -

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
- does that give us ECS also?

TELMU
That gives us glycol circulation.

FLIGHT
Okay, how about ECS? Come on, I need some oxygen.

EECOM
Disregard the surge tank request.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
Give me some oxygen.

TELMU
Negative.

FLIGHT
Do I need some oxygen right now?

TELMU
Roger - just go to Activation step 1.

FLIGHT
And start there, huh?

TELMU
Right.

FLIGHT
And go how many steps? Activation -

TELMU
Just 1. Step 3.

FLIGHT
Uh.

TELMU
Activation 1, step 3, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Step 3?

TELMU
Right.

FLIGHT
And then what? Activation 11?

TELMU
Activation 11 -

FLIGHT
12?

TELMU
12, 13 step 1.

FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?

CAPCOM
I've got Activation 1 step 3; Activation 11, 12, 13 step 1.

TELMU
Roger, and FLIGHT, in Activation 11, omit step 1.

FLIGHT
Alright.

57:43:01
FLIGHT
Okay. That'll give them what, now; glycol flow, COMM, and some ECS? Is that right? That's what we want.

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay. That's what we want.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
One other input: we also need the DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

FLIGHT
Roger.

FLIGHT
Do you want them to do Activation 1 down to step 3 - TELMU?

57:44:00
TELMU
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
It's down to step 3.

FLIGHT
Down to step 3.

FLIGHT
That's 12 and 13.

FLIGHT
And DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

FLIGHT
Right.

FLIGHT
TELMU, when do we do DEMAND REGs to CABIN? That's the end of those three steps?

TELMU
At the end of the sequence.

FLIGHT
At the end of the sequence, DEMAND REGs to CABIN, Jack.

FLIGHT
And I - I'm still not satisfied he's got Activation 1 down to step 3.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. The voltage is going to begin to drop and we'll need to power down with it.

FLIGHT
Okay. What do you want them to do? Turn everything off?

EECOM
Leave the lights on, and - leave the lights on. As far as they need it.

FLIGHT
And where do they power it from, the LM?

EECOM
That'll be power from the CSM as long as we have anything. We will bring up BAT A when we get down about 25 volts or so.

FLIGHT
Why?

EECOM
Until they get into the LM and keep their lights up and whatever they have to have.

57:45:03
GNC
We don't want to destroy the IMU alignment in the CSM right now, so we've got to keep that up, I assume, until you get the LM aligned, right?

FLIGHT
Mm. Okay.

EECOM
We'll do that by bringing BAT A on MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Well, we'd better quickly do that or we're going to be losing it.

EECOM
We've got 3 or 4 minutes, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah -

GNC
But the thing is, we want to pass to them - when he does see it go down. Or, start going down. To get BATTERY A On.

FLIGHT
Is that -

GNC
To watch it.

FLIGHT
Now, you think we really want to spend that to keep the platform on? We're using the entry batteries, too.

EECOM
What we take out of the battery we won't get back.

FLIGHT
That's right.

FLIGHT
No. Down to step 3. Down to step 3. All the way down to step 3.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Alright, okay. I just want to be sure we're sure we want to do that. And quick, get a coarse align. CONTROL and TELMU, will the steps I got give me a coarse align?

57:46:01
FLIGHT
CONTROL and TELMU -

TELMU
Negative, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead; CONTROL here.

FLIGHT
Will those steps that we've passed so far get me a coarse align?

TELMU
Negative, that just gets you -

CONTROL
Standby.

FLIGHT
What else I gotta do to get a coarse align?

CONTROL
Standby, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Can we get those read up to the crew to step the power down? Of course, they can power down everything, but here's a good start.

FLIGHT (off loop)
?? the battery will drain as they power down?

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Then it's just the IMU?

EECOM
That's roger.

FLIGHT
Okay, but we wanted to keep that up for a little while, I thought you just said, with the BATTERY A. To get a coarse align on the LM.

EECOM
Well, maybe there's a bit of confusion here.

FLIGHT
Yeah. You just gave - you don't want to turn the IMU off until we get a coarse align on the LM, right?

EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

GNC
That's affirm, FLIGHT. And we'll support a battery until you get that.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power on down the CSM only. We want to put BAT A on - about now? EECOM?

EECOM
Negative, not yet, FLIGHT. We'll let you know.

FLIGHT
We're going to put BATTERY A on - can you put it on while it's charging?

Maroon EECOM
No. We'll have to take the charge off.

EECOM
Negative.

FLIGHT
We want to take -

Maroon EECOM
We'll have to power down the charger and put it on MAIN A.

FLIGHT
Alright.

57:47:05
TELMU
The VHF is not required, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No VHF.

FLIGHT
Well.

FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL.

CONTROL
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Look, it's unclear enough to me that I'm going to try to get a coarse align in the LM. You know where we are, then, right, Will?

FLIGHT
Alright. Now, what do I have to do to get it?

CONTROL
Okay, I'm getting you that step right now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
When we get a little lower, we're going to have them pull BAT A off, and we'll get him to put it on MAIN BUS A. We are then going to try to hold up the IMU long enough to get a coarse align in the LM, and then we'll see whether we're going to keep that coarse align up or not, but for right now we're running the profiles and we'll have to determine that.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
That's the course of action, let Jack know that much.

CAPCOM
Okay. And he wants to know what he's going to see and what he should do when he sees it happen to FUEL CELL 2.

57:48:04
FLIGHT
We're interested in keeping up the IMU and the lights, for him to see. That's all.

FLIGHT
EECOM, GNC: everything else goes off? INCO?

GNC
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

INCO
Good plan.

FLIGHT
GNC? Anything else goes off?

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

EECOM
The only concern we have, FLIGHT, I just -

FLIGHT
Yeah, go ahead.

EECOM
- is the IMU heater power. And - for the CSM.

FLIGHT
Well? What do you want?

EECOM
Well, if you want to maintain the IMU for re-entry, we've got to have the heater power on.

FLIGHT
How much is that?

EECOM
Standby, we'll take a look.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM, we can take it off at any time.

FLIGHT
Take it off now, Jack.

FLIGHT
Take it off.

CAPCOM
Okay, I need some LM IMU align procedures.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
We need to go ahead and start that power down any time.

57:49:02
FLIGHT
Okay, do you want me to put BATTERY A on yet?

Maroon EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Negative, we'll give you a cue on that.

FLIGHT
Okay. Where do you want me to tell them to start, Clint?

EECOM
Keep your lights up and everything else has got to go.

FLIGHT
Everything else except the IMU.

Maroon EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay. Say again?

EECOM
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
How about the COMM? We don't have COMM yet with the LM.

INCO
As soon as you take that POWER AMPL off we're going to lose data.

FLIGHT
Okay, well let's - yes, let's be clear what we're doing here.

FLIGHT
We're discontinuing BATTERY A.

FLIGHT
Okay, so far I've got the IMU and the POWER AMPL up. Anything else?

INCO
That should do it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How about COMM?

INCO
Leave the PCM up, too. Leave the COMM configuration alone.

FLIGHT
Yeah, leave the COMM configuration alone, CAPCOM, until we get COMM with the LM.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
Okay, we've got one more - we want to make sure his SUIT FAN 1 is - our SUIT FAN is positioned to 1.

57:50:01
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

TELMU
And the - on panel 11 we want ECS SUIT FAN 1 breaker closed.

FLIGHT
Okay, you want SUIT FAN number 1 on.

TELMU
Yeah.

FLIGHT
With the breaker. Go ahead, CONTROL.

CONTROL
Okay, FLIGHT, here's what we need.

FLIGHT
Alright, standby. CAPCOM, in the LM we need the SUIT FAN number 1 and its circuit breaker on to get flow, and CONTROL's coming to me with the IMU procedure. Go, CONTROL.

CONTROL
Panel 11. LGC/DSKY closed.

FLIGHT
That's the circuit breaker?

CONTROL
Yes.

FLIGHT
Panel 11 closed; yup.

CONTROL
Okay. Then go to Activation page 25, do steps 1, 2, and 3.

FLIGHT
1, 2, and 3? And what will that get us?

CONTROL
Okay, that'll get everything up and running and the platform turned on.

FLIGHT
And will that get us a coarse align?

CONTROL
Negative, that'll put you in P00.

FLIGHT
Okay, and then do -

CONTROL
Go to Activation 37.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
Docked IMU coarse align procedure is there for you.

FLIGHT
Okay. Got it, CAPCOM?

CONTROL
Excuse me - 30. That's Activation 30, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay. I've got LGC/DSKY close, Activation 25 steps 1, 2, and 3, Activation 30.

57:51:05
FLIGHT
Okay, TELMU, one more question. Are we bringing up glycol flow here?

TELMU
We brought up circulation. We have not activated the boiler.

FLIGHT
Should we?

TELMU
I don't know; we're working on it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Alright.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
Okay, when we go through this power down when we bring BAT A up, we want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure for fuel cell 2, just in case the pressure should recover and we would still have a fuel cell later. Which is not likely, but it's not going to cost us anything to do it except a little time.

FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 2 shutdown; that closes the reactants?

EECOM
I'm - I'm sorry. Standby. Standby's the word.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay.

FLIGHT
You want me to put fuel cell number 2 on standby when? After we put BATTERY A on?

EECOM
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
How close are we to doing that?

EECOM
Well, we're looking for it any time now.

FLIGHT
Alright.

57:52:04
FLIGHT
Have we got anybody over in the LM yet, Jack? Can you tell? Somebody climbed over there? They're both over there?

CAPCOM
Yeah, we've got them both over there, and they've just taken the procedure for the activation of the IMU.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay. I don't know how long we'll be able to keep that up, but at least we'll have something.

CAPCOM
Okay, and what other things you've got to go up that I missed while I was talking?

CAPCOM
Have we given them the signal on the battery yet?

FLIGHT
Uh, no.

EECOM
Negative on that.

Maroon EECOM
About another 20 psi, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GNC, FLIGHT. What do you want on the heater? Circuit breakers?

GNC
We're still working on that, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it - find out if we can power them down and bring the platform up later on, whether we've really got a problem there or not.

FLIGHT
Alright. Go ahead. We'll have BMAGs.

57:53:02
GNC
Roger.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
We can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off anytime.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
BYPASS on the primary rads.

Maroon EECOM
Turn the GLYCOL PUMP off.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, he can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off in the CSM.

CAPCOM
Okay.

EECOM
BYPASS on the rads.

FLIGHT
BYPASS on the rads, and then turn the pump off, huh?

EECOM
Roger.

Maroon EECOM
In that order.

FLIGHT
Okay. BYPASS, and then PUMP off.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
Okay, we should be okay thermally in the LM vehicle until we get telemetry, and we'll watch it until we tell you to turn on the boiler.

FLIGHT
Okay, fair enough. You can look at TM before you tell me about the sublimators. Thank you.

57:54:00
TELMU
Roger that.

FLIGHT
BYPASS and the GLYCOL PUMP coming off.

CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. Anything else I missed while I was talking to them there?

FLIGHT
Uh, I don't know, Jack. I haven't been following everything you've said, you did tell them that we're going to be putting BATTERY A on to keep the IMU up. I don't know how much time we've got here; another 20psi was the last I heard.

CAPCOM
Yeah, and I'm standing by for a mark on that.

FLIGHT
Yeah. How much power have we got left on in the CSM, EECOM? We haven't got a lot on -

EECOM
We've got about 40 amps.

FLIGHT
Okay. What else can we take off right now?

EECOM
We passed the list to CAPCOM while we had the IMU heaters - IMU on it. Everything on that list but the IMU.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Got it, Jack? You want them to start powering that stuff down, right Clint?

EECOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay, Jack. Everything but that IMU.

57:55:13
EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
O₂ TANK 2 FANS off.

FLIGHT
You're giving up there, huh?

EECOM
Giving up.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, O₂ FANS 2 off.

CAPCOM
Say again, please?

FLIGHT
O₂ TANK 2 FANS can go off. There's nothing happening there.

EECOM
That's confirmed. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, FLIGHT. That's 1, 2, 3.

FLIGHT
You want to shut 2 down, now?

Maroon EECOM
That's affirm.

EECOM
Just the pumps. Just turn the pumps off.

FLIGHT
Oh. Okay. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, CAPCOM. That may be a verify.

CAPCOM
Okay, verify all FUEL CELL PUMPs off, and -

FLIGHT
Fans off.

CAPCOM
- fans off in O₂ TANK 2.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

57:56:02
INCO
FLIGHT, INCO, we have the LM downlink coming in.

CAPCOM
We don't want them fans and heaters in TANK 1, do we?

FLIGHT
EECOM, you don't want anything on in TANK 1, do you? Or do you?

EECOM
Roger, we want them all on.

FLIGHT
Leave them all on in TANK 1, CAPCOM.

EECOM
That's affirmative.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
I'm still seeing 40 amps. What all have we got on there, EECOM? CMC? IMU?

EECOM
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
And some COMM.

EECOM
IMU and CMC still up right now.

FLIGHT
And SUIT FAN.

FLIGHT
Now, EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Look, I'm worried about shutting this thing down so that it's safe when we want to repower it from the entry batteries.

EECOM
Roger. We don't - we're going to ask you to bring up BAT A whenever we see the voltage begin to drop off.

FLIGHT
I understand that, I still want some kind of closeout configuration. Okay?

EECOM
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
GNC, same with you. And I haven't heard from you on the heaters yet, on the IMU.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. Preliminary look at it, looks like we can pull all the circuit breakers - power on the heaters. But we're still trying to get a handle on it.

57:57:04
FLIGHT
We may well have no choice.

GNC
That's a fact.

FLIGHT
I don't know - how many amps do they take?

GNC
10.

FLIGHT
Aw! 10 amps!?

GNC
Roger.

FLIGHT
I got - I'm looking at a hundred and - I'm looking at - fif, sixt, 80 hours!

GNC
Okay. Roger.

FLIGHT
That's academic!

GNC
I understand.

CAPCOM
And FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, I've got a procedure for COMM activation; 28 on the panel here. It came from somewhere, is this something you want to go up?

FLIGHT
INCO, is that the COMM activation in the LM?

INCO
Negative, FLIGHT, the COMM activation is the same as you've got over there, except we want to change to normal VOICE when he gets squared away. I gave him some steerable angles in case we want to activate it. So I have it - and that's the procedure.

FLIGHT
Can we go on the OMNI right now?

INCO
Roger. As we come up on the Goldstone with the 210 we'll be alright.

NETWORK
We have AOS with the 210 now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We'll stick with the OMNI, yeah, Jack. So don't do anything with that.

NETWORK
FLIGHT, we have OMNI data on the LM right now.

FLIGHT
We have AOS on the LM.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GNC
We've got a better number on that heater power; it only draws about 0.8 amps. So we'd like to leave that up.

57:58:04
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
The temp looks good. 129.9.

FLIGHT
Okay. 0.8 amps for the rest of the mission is going to cost me 64 amp-hours. GNC, FLIGHT.

GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
It's going to cost me 64 amp-hours.

FLIGHT
I can't afford that! Can't I bring it back up without them? Is that absolutely known?

GNC
Yeah, I think you can, FLIGHT, but the platform's way off -

FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

Maroon EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Turn around here a minute. He's talking about the IMU heater, it's going to cost me 0.8 amps, I'm - 142 hours at landing - I'm 80 hours away. That's 64 amp-hours.

EECOM
Forever?

FLIGHT
Can you hack that out of the entry batteries?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

EECOM
We might hack it transferring power back from the LM to the CSM, but we can't hack it on the batteries.

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. Since it's only 0.8 amps let's hack it for a little while here. Then we -

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

57:59:00
FLIGHT
Go ahead, TELMU.

TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT. It looks like they are still on low-volt taps. We need to get the Activation step 12 substep 3 and go to high taps on the LM batteries, 1 through 4.

FLIGHT
Got it, Jack?

CAPCOM
You want the high taps on the batteries, 1 through 4?

TELMU
Roger, that's Activation 12 step 3. Looks like they're still on low taps.

58:00:00
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, did you give them that about the high taps?

CAPCOM
I gave them that about the high taps and they're going through it -

TELMU
FLIGHT, looks like we're going to high taps.

FLIGHT
Alright.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Calling, FLIGHT.

INCO
INCO. We'd like to get normal voice on the LM on panel 12. FUNCTION switch to VOICE.

FLIGHT
It's coming at you now.

INCO
Okay.

FLIGHT
Okay. Everybody in the room, how about sitting down a minute, and just keeping it a little bit quiet?

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
All our systems look real good on LOW BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

TELMU
FLIGHT, we look good. TELMU's good.

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
We need SUIT GAS diverted to CABIN.

FLIGHT
SUIT GAS diverted to CABIN in the LM, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Okay, they're doing the coarse align now. CONTROL, can you see your platform?

58:01:02
CONTROL
Negative. We're on LOW BIT RATE.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

CONTROL
We don't have resolvers.

FLIGHT
Say again?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
Okay, we want them to go all the way through to the fine align, past the angles test so we can get a good alignment with the CSM because that CSM is continuing to move.

FLIGHT
Which step do you want to get to?

GUIDO
We want to go all the way through to step 7 in the LM Activation.

CAPCOM
What page?

CONTROL
31.

GUIDO
On page 31.

CAPCOM
Okay, step 7, page 31.

FLIGHT
All the way through that, Jack, that's what he means.

GUIDO
That's affirm.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
Okay, we expect to put the battery on any time now. We're still going to give you a cue on it.

FLIGHT
Okay.

58:02:04
FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
While they're working the problem, do you want me to leave BATTERY A on MAIN BUS A?

EECOM
When we give you the cue, we'll put -

FLIGHT
For that IMU heater?

FLIGHT
Is that what your plan is?

EECOM
Until we get - until we get through to the LM, that's right.

FLIGHT
Okay. Now, doesn't - GNC, I wanted to hear from both you guys whether you want to leave that on the whole time, but we can stand 0.8 for now on the entry bat.

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We're - we feel like we'd probably be able to power it down.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GNC
Preliminary look at it.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
We indicate he still has the LDG RDR HEATERS on; he can open those up if he desires - panel 11 row 3.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
They're in the middle of the align.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
But remind me again in a minute, CONTROL.

CONTROL
Okay.

58:03:23
CAPCOM
Are we still awaiting the mark on BAT A?

FLIGHT
I don't know. EECOM, how far away from BAT A?

EECOM
FLIGHT, any time now, but the voltage is still up. We'll cue you.

FLIGHT
Okay, well, I'm afraid it'll go fast, aren't you?

EECOM
Well, we - it'll go pretty fast when it gets there.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you primed Jack about BAT A, haven't you?

CAPCOM
I told him we'd give him a mark on BAT A. He wanted to know what to watch for. He'll see the voltage drop but we'll give him the mark.

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

Maroon EECOM
O₂ to N₂ ∆P is dropping; let's turn BATTERY A on.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, BATTERY A on.

FLIGHT
Tell him to hurry.

58:04:00
FLIGHT
He got it. Good boy.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, copy the numbers.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, copy those numbers.

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You got BATTERY A on there, EECOM? 11 amps.

EECOM
That's affirmative, FLIGHT. It's on.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Let me know when they're all done and you've got what you want in the LM, because I want to get that CSM powered down.

GUIDO
Okay. We can't watch the LM, FLIGHT, we don't have the HIGH BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
Okay, but from the voice.

58:05:00
GUIDO
Okay. Roger.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go.

INCO
We can get HIGH BIT RATE from the LM.

FLIGHT
Does it cost me any power?

INCO
No. We'd like for him to go to panel 12; we'd like to go FUNCTION switch to VOICE, and HIGH BIT RATE on PCM.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, got that?

Maroon EECOM
INCO, EECOM. Meet me on number 1.

CAPCOM
Say again, please?

FLIGHT
They want to go to HIGH BIT RATE in the LM. Won't cost us any power. And they can tell a little more.

CAPCOM
And, FLIGHT, we checking his arithmetic? On the -

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, arithmetic?

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How's the arithmetic?

GUIDO
Standby, we'll check it.

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

Maroon EECOM
If we can get LOW BIT RATE with the POWER AMPL off, let's turn the PRIMARY POWER AMPL off on the COMM system. There's no sense in -

58:06:04
FLIGHT
INCO? Can we do that?

INCO
Yes. Let's try it.

FLIGHT
CSM POWER AMPL off?

INCO
LOW BIT RATE. DOWN VOICE BACKUP.

FLIGHT
You need him to do that?

INCO
Yes.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. LOW BIT RATE. DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and POWER AMPL OFF in the CSM.

CAPCOM
Okay.

Maroon EECOM
INCO, EECOM. Meet me on number 1.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
We need to get the SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.

FLIGHT
Yes.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, LM: SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, how's that arithmetic?

GUIDO
It looks good, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
The arithmetic is go?

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, the arithmetic's good.

FLIGHT
Does that mean we've got an alignment now?

58:07:00
GUIDO
A coarse align.

Other GUIDO
We've got a coarse align, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM -

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
As soon as we've got the alignment and we're finished with it we're going CMC OFF, IMU OFF, we'll leave the heater circuit breakers on powered from - BATTERY A. Until you tell me whether we need to keep them up or not.

CAPCOM
How come we're getting so much noise on the COMM?

FLIGHT
Don't know. INCO?

INCO
We'd like them to do a COMMAND RESET on the CSM so we can get the LOW BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
I thought we just told them that.

INCO
We did, but the way the commands work and everything -

58:08:02
FLIGHT
Alright. They're in the middle of it, I'll give it to them in a minute.

INCO
Okay.

FLIGHT
We're turning off some more of the instrumentation, gentlemen.

58:09:02
FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, have they got the fine align down to where you want it, yet?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, we need him to read the angles to us. We've lost CSM data; we don't know what the CSM got on the 06 20.

FLIGHT
Okay, you really need that, huh?

GUIDO
Right.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, they need a VERB 06 NOUN 20 on the CSM. We lost it.

FLIGHT
Here they are.

GUIDO
Copy, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yup.

58:10:06
FLIGHT
You got everything you need, GUIDANCE?

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

EECOM
We're ready to go ahead and power down the CMC now.

FLIGHT
Wait a minute. I want to be sure the guidance is alright.

EECOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, can one of you tell me if you've got everything you need?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, we got everything.

Other GUIDO
We're working on it now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Now - my question really is: when can I turn the CMC off? Are we that far enough through the procedure that we can turn it off? Yes or no, that's all I'm -

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We are, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You are.

GUIDO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go.

INCO
If you get us that COMMAND RESET we'll get some data; we're blind here.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well - in the CSM, you mean?

INCO
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
We're turning it down anyway, right now, Ed.

FLIGHT
CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time. You've got everything you need through to fine align and we can proceed to power down the IMU in the CSM, correct?

58:11:05
GUIDO
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, and we'll leave the heaters on. Heater power circuit breaker on in the CSM.

CONTROL
Check LM LDG RDR heater breaker also.

FLIGHT
Yeah. CAPCOM, for the CSM. We've got the fine align data and everything is set up so therefore we can start powering down the CMC and the IMU. For now leave the heater circuit breaker on, and the BATTERY A on the bus like it is. We're running that IMU heater to ground to see whether we need to leave that on or not. And here's the - paper -

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. 

GNC
We got the go ahead to turn the heater power off.

FLIGHT
Say again?

GNC
IMU HEATER power to OFF.

FLIGHT
And we'll still have it?

GNC
That's right. We feel that we have a real good chance of bringing the platform up in good shape.

FLIGHT
Now, do you want more time to debate it? I'm willing to give you 0.8 of an amp.

GNC
I don't really know how much debate really needs to be done on that.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. We need some data. We need to get the LOW BIT RATE - I think we need COMMAND RESET.

FLIGHT
CS - CAPCOM, CSM COMMAND RESET, and then give them those instructions. We've got enough, we might as well save what we can on the battery now, and power down.

58:12:05
CAPCOM
You want the CMC and IMU powered down?

FLIGHT
Yup.

CAPCOM
And heater circuit breaker - heaters off. Off on the -

FLIGHT
And all the heaters, etc.

EECOM
And COMMAND RESET.

FLIGHT
And COMMAND RESET before they -

CAPCOM
And you want BAT A, huh?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

58:13:04
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
Okay, we've been watching glycol temps and I guess we'd better go ahead and crank up the water boiler. This is Activation 20 - - Activation -

FLIGHT
Listen. Listen.

TELMU
And Activation 21 step 3.

FLIGHT
Do you want to leave BATTERY A on? EECOM? Is that still the story? For how long?

EECOM
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
How long will you want to do that?

EECOM
Until we get squared away with the LM.

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Okay.

Maroon EECOM
All RCS AUTOs OFF, the 16 plus the 2 FDAIs OFF.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Got that, CAPCOM?

Maroon EECOM
??

FLIGHT
Alright.

58:14:03
FLIGHT
Yeah. Before we turn his thrusters off in the CSM, CAPCOM, you'd better verify they've got some control in the LM.

CONTROL
FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
Plus, they need to bring up the water boiler. Go ahead, calling, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
This is CONTROL. You mentioned them powering up the RCS; is that right?

FLIGHT
Well -

CONTROL
We're going to have to do that.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay.

INCO
CSM data - CSM data, FLIGHT

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Heaters, fans, O₂ TANK 1 off.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, all TANK 1 off.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
Disregard, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, have him go and get that stuff off.

58:15:01
FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
AUTO - all the AUTO RCS and the heaters in TANK 1. 

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

EECOM
They've got to get the power off when they can.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Well, we just handed it to CAPCOM.

58:16:05
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
Okay, did you copy we need to crank up the glycol loop?

FLIGHT
Yeah -

TELMU
Activation 20.

FLIGHT
Activation 20?

TELMU
On the glycol loop activation. And Activation 21 step 3.

FLIGHT
Down to step 3 or step 3 only?

TELMU
No. Step 3 only.

FLIGHT
Activation 20 and Activation 21 step 3 only.

TELMU
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
20 amps.

58:17:06
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT. For the LM, he needs to get his sublimator up -

FLIGHT
Yeah.

EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Jack, the LM needs to get the sublimator up. Activation 20, and 21. For 21, step 3 only. Go ahead, EECOM.

EECOM
You can go ahead and get those O₂ TANK 1 heaters off soon. That's a big chunk.

FLIGHT
Yeah, O₂ -

CAPCOM
You want O₂ TANK heaters off -

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Okay. And Activation 20 and 21 step 3.

FLIGHT
Yup. Get the sublimator up.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
We need to get our RCS heaters on. Start those warming up. And get the RCS system pressurized, if we're going to be going out of CSM control here very shortly.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we are.

CONTROL
That needs to be taken care of, first, first.

FLIGHT
Okay.

58:18:01
TELMU
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM -

EECOM
O₂ TANK 1 heaters and fans.

FLIGHT
Yeah. O₂ TANK 1.

FLIGHT
TANK 1.

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead - that was to the - that was for the CSM, that FDAI.

58:19:03
FLIGHT
And for the LM, CAPCOM, we need RCS heaters on, they need to pressurize the RCS to have control. And for the water sublimator, Activation 20 and 21 step 3.

CAPCOM
Okay. I gave them 20 and 21 step 3 already -

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
- and you want RCS heaters on in -

FLIGHT
Yeah, RCS pressurize - we didn't tell him to pull the FDAI in the LM.

CAPCOM
No, that was the CSM.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Does he understand that? Does that - Jim, does - has he -

FLIGHT
CONTROL, do you want them to power the balls up and RCS?

CONTROL
Definitely the RCS, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well, they need the ball to tell where they are.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, yeah, get a ball up in - one ball up and RCS heaters. And press.

58:20:01
CONTROL
And they need to have all of the circuit breakers in for the ISOL VALVES and the main SOVs, FLIGHT. On panels 11 and 16.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, in an orderly fashion, please. Ready. What you want, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Okay, how's the CSM? Anything for the CSM?

Maroon EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

FLIGHT
Go.

Maroon EECOM
I think we're ready to power the main buses down. If everybody's ready.

GUIDO
They don't have attitude control in the LM, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Let's be sure we have control in the LM. Although he's probably out of jets right now. GNC, you got anything for the CSM?

GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. For the LM, we think he ought to have an eight-ball, and we ought to get his RCS heaters on, his RCS pressurized, and he needs to get all his circuit breakers on 11 and 16 closed for control.

CONTROL
Yeah, and Jack, what we're talking about is the QUAD HEATER breakers, the MAIN SOVs, and ISOL VALVE breakers on panels 11 and 16.

CAPCOM
Don't you have an Activation page I can just tell them to turn to?

CONTROL
Yeah, if you want to close all those dadgum breakers. On that page. And then he can go back and open them all up later, the ones he doesn't need. That's Activation 22 and 23.

58:21:22
FLIGHT
EECOM, GNC, copy his question?

EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Jack wants to know how we wanted to proceed with the SCS. Go ahead, John.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT, you giving us something for getting your RCS up?

CONTROL
Yes sir, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Hurry up, will you please?

CONTROL
Yeah.

FLIGHT
We've just got a lot of traffic for the CAPCOM.

CONTROL
Wilco.

58:22:17
GNC
Okay, FLIGHT, GNC. The CMC and the IMU are completely powered down at this time.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Copy all that, CONTROL?

CONTROL
FLIGHT, put the TCA breakers in last. The TCA breakers in last.

FLIGHT
Okay. TCA breakers in last.

58:23:07
FLIGHT
Yup. That works.

CONTROL
Copy, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. CONTROL, do you understand the configuration we're getting into?

CONTROL
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Do you understand the configuration we're getting into?

CONTROL
Right now, as I understand it, we're getting into a PGNS attitude control mode -

FLIGHT
Okay -

CONTROL
- it'll be ATTITUDE HOLD.

FLIGHT
Okay. My point is - let's be careful with what we're telling the CAPCOM to do here; try to give him as clear instructions by switches or Activation pages as we can, okay? Now -

CONTROL
Okay, but the circuit breakers -

FLIGHT
I know.

CONTROL
- are all botched together on these charts, FLIGHT -

58:24:00
FLIGHT
I know. Okay, you're ready to power down the inverters, the BATTERY RELAY BUS, and you're ready to pull the entry battery off.

Maroon EECOM
That's right. Now, that's not all completely configured to do it, but I think we've got to get off entry battery and then do it with voice, FLIGHT. Through the LM. COMM. That's going to kill COMM and everything.

FLIGHT
Yeah. You're ready to do that. Is everybody ready to kill COMM in the CSM? GNC?

GNC
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You ready to kill COMM in the CSM?

GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GNC. GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We're going to turn down the CSM.

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
Yeah; I want to be sure we've got control somewhere. I'm not satisfied we do yet. Attitude control.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay. We haven't got ourselves into a position here where we have no attitude control in either vehicle, have we?

FLIGHT
I'm waiting to see when we get attitude control in the LM. Would they - would you ask them to call us when they have attitude control in the LM, and then we'll power the inverters, et cetera down in the CSM?

58:25:07
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Okay, once they get control established, we're going to do some setup work as far as loading the DAP to get his -

FLIGHT
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

FLIGHT
I just want to get attitude control first.

CONTROL
Roger.  He's had to put his PGNS MODE control switch to ATT HOLD.

FLIGHT
Oh yeah. Okay.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Say again?

CAPCOM
Hey FLIGHT, they don't have attitude control in the - we don't have CM/SM -

FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay. Well, they're trying to get it up, right?

CAPCOM
Yeah, they are.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Okay. I just - what you want to know - pardon -

58:26:15
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
We're getting pretty close into gimbal lock, as I understand it. We need to get that RCS pressurized and on the line -

FLIGHT
Yeah, well, they're on the way of doing it.

FLIGHT (off loop)
He didn't have a ball to do it with.

CONTROL
He's got the DSKY, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No - who he? CSM or the LM?

GUIDO
The LM.

GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

FLIGHT
Go ahead - wait a minute, GNC. Yeah, we're having a control problem. What's the best way to get it; are you saying the LM, CAPCOM?

FLIGHT
Alright.

GUIDO
He can go DIRECT RCS, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have him go DIRECT RCS and hold attitude in the CSM.

58:27:37
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Can you wait a minute?

TELMU
We're going to have to have AC here, for this.

FLIGHT
For what?

TELMU
For the balls.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, they need AC.

58:28:00
TELMU
Both of them go in, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Did you copy, TELMU?

TELMU
Roger, his LOGIC POWER breakers should be in. A and B.

FLIGHT
A and B LOGIC should be in.

CONTROL
RCS is pressurized.

FLIGHT
Alright.

TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here for the AC coming at you.

FLIGHT
CAP - he needs AC for the eight-ball - CAPCOM. We need to get AC powered up in the LM. I'm sure they know the procedure, but there it is.

58:29:20
FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What's our current level in the LM?

TELMU
41 amps.

TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, TELMU.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
We show him still armed. We'd ask him to go MASTER ARM off.

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
Okay, we've got AC, FLIGHT. Looks good.

58:30:03
FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
We see the pyros are disarmed now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
TELMU - er, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Go ahead. I copy.

FLIGHT
Do you want him to do that?

CONTROL
The checkout? There's no need for it, FLIGHT. All we need to do is -

CAPCOM
He wants to know if you want him to go down Activation 37.

58:31:00
CONTROL
Negative.

FLIGHT
Is he - has he got control now?

CONTROL
Negative, he does not. I don't think he has his TCA breakers in yet.

FLIGHT
Okay. But what do you want him to do?

CONTROL
I want to get his TCA breakers in after he's got everything else configured, and then he can be in - he'll be in PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD.

FLIGHT
Okay, there's no -

CONTROL
5 degree deadband.

FLIGHT
Anything needs to be done in the DAP?

CONTROL
Yeah, we're going to have to load the DAP, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well, do we want to be in PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD? Before we load it? Come on, now -

CONTROL
We've got the TCAs in now, and everything looks real good right now, FLIGHT. We can load the DAP with no problem.

FLIGHT
Okay, what numbers you want them to put to get it?

CONTROL
DAP data load is for - this configuration is for 30120.

FLIGHT
30120.

CONTROL
Right. And we'll have to give you some weights; we don't have those yet.

58:32:04
FLIGHT
Approximately.

FLIGHT
Do we need a weight to go in there?

CAPCOM
What do we have on weight?

CONTROL
CSM weight: 63400.

FLIGHT
63400.

CONTROL
That's CSM weight.

FLIGHT
CSM.

CAPCOM
Okay, are we ready to go to PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD now?

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You ready for PGNCS attitude control now?

CONTROL
He's in P00 now, he - he's in ATTITUDE HOLD right now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
How about it?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

58:33:05
FLIGHT
Tell - be sure he tells Jack that.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
Couldn't really copy - he may be having a problem firing his jets?

FLIGHT
I don't know. I didn't hear.

FLIGHT
He's asking if he's firing.

CONTROL
Need to - make sure his ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker is in.

CAPCOM
Okay, what other control circuit breakers do you want in?

FLIGHT
If he's having trouble, check his ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker.

CONTROL
ATCA (PGNS) breaker on panel 11, row 3.

58:34:00
CAPCOM
ATCA (PGNS) and what else?

CONTROL
And the ATTITUDE DIRECT control breaker - he's got that if he's got DIRECT right now.

FLIGHT
Okay. That must have been what it was.

CONTROL
That should have it.

CAPCOM
Okay, can we check the switch configuration circuit breakers and the black boxes to make sure everything's configured correctly for attitude control?

FLIGHT
Yeah. I'd like to be sure the LM is okay while we power the CSM down, now.

58:35:01
FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay - yeah, I heard him holler up the tunnel.

FLIGHT
Yeah. CONTROL, are you okay?

CONTROL
Yeah, we've got one TCP switch firing -

FLIGHT
Okay. But are you okay?

CONTROL
Well, we look okay now, and we'll need another DSKY entry here very shortly to inhibit our upward-firing jets.

FLIGHT
Alright. TELMU, are you okay?

TELMU
Roger, FLIGHT, we're doing pretty good. I've got to get with you in a little while on -

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
- high ASCENT O₂ pressure.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. GUIDANCE, you okay in the LM?

GUIDO
We're good, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. GNC and EECOM. We're going to power down. You ready?

GNC
We're ready, FLIGHT.

EECOM
EECOM. Go.

CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. They've got attitude control in the LM now. What do you want to do with the CSM?

FLIGHT
Okay, here it is, right behind you, Jack. For powering it down. There's the paper.

58:36:11
FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Are there any switches you want in the off position before we power down? Like, for example, compressors or anything?

Maroon EECOM
No, FLIGHT. Let's just power - this down, we'll fix it later -

FLIGHT
Okay. Okay.

58:37:55
FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
You want them to open-circuit fuel cell 2, right?

58:38:00
Maroon EECOM
That's affirm, if he hasn't done it.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We okay there with them? Right now?

CAPCOM
Okay, open -

Maroon EECOM
Just close the REAC valves, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Just close them. Just close the REACs.

NETWORK
FLIGHT, NETWORK.

FLIGHT
Go.

NETWORK
We lost both CPs. We'll be up in a minute.

FLIGHT
Hurry up.

58:39:01
FLIGHT
We just lost data in the building, gentlemen. It's the CPs. Standby.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
My problem, next, when I get around to it with you guys, is going to be what configuration to power down to.

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
At the present time I'm thinking I'd like to keep the LM IMU up through the burn -

FLIGHT
- we're up on the CPs. But that's about as far as I've got it through. Everybody's running power profiles, and Jim McDivitt's people have those set of numbers right now.

TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, we're working on it.

58:40:01
FLIGHT
EECOM, are you all the way down yet?

EECOM
Looks like the inverter went off, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
So he's in the process. Alright.

FLIGHT
Copy, CAPCOM. Thank you.

FLIGHT
Okay, look, gentlemen -

FLIGHT
We - good LM data? EECOM? TELMU.

TELMU
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

NETWORK
- here it is.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we have it.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO, we've got a problem.

58:41:02
FLIGHT
We going to have good data here for a while?

INCO
In and out, FLIGHT. We've got a different problem. By turning off the CSM, we end up without any good tracking data. There's no way we can get any tracking data. That LM data is biased because of the uplink shift, and data select cannot use that tracking data.

INCO
Consequently, somewhere in here we're going to have to bring up some kind of tracking on the CSM again.

FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT.

FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Would you figure that out? We're well clear now of the Moon, right?

FDO
Roger that. As far as we can tell we are, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
And we need to - why can't we track this LM? Why is this LM interference - this IU interference -

INCO
That's right, because we had to bias off that frequency to change it down, making a bias in the data; that data's no good.

FLIGHT
Is it possible to go back to the original and just leave this -

INCO
We already tried it, FLIGHT. We tried it already. Doesn't work.

FLIGHT
Okay, Ed. Thank you.

FLIGHT
Mrrh. Okay.

58:42:01
FLIGHT
Okay, everybody, look. We've got a number of long-range problems right now. We have the burn to do, which is at about 79 hours: 28 hours from now. And that's one business. We have to get the track up as we need it to take care of that burn. Hopefully we won't need to do too much with that, although I don't know how many amps that's going to take. However, right now, I want to be sure that we get the whole situation stabilized with the LM and the CSM. We've got to start bringing the LM power down some, and get any non-required stuff off the line so we don't use up any of these amp-hours that we don't need to give away. And I want you to pay attention to the configuration we're currently in and get the people offline working on the longer-range problems, especially the lifeboat problems now associated with the LM.

FLIGHT
You know, LiOH, etc.

FLIGHT
Let's get all that configured. But right now I want the guys who are in the room to concentrate on keeping this thing right now going along all right, and watching it.

FLIGHT
Alright.

58:43:02
CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, my gyro torquing angles still good?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, are those gyro torques still good?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
And the crew wants those?

GUIDO
Roger. We ought to go ahead and fine align the platform.

FLIGHT
There you go, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
Okay, and on these - Fred asked the question, he'd like to pull some circuit breakers on displays and have us watch them; is he clear to do that?

FLIGHT
CONTROL and TELMU.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you have good data there, and we can pull the display circuit breakers in the cockpit?

CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT. Just about ready.

FLIGHT
Okay. Yes, gentlemen.

CAPCOM
They want you to tell me what circuit breakers to pull, and I want them - defined as to panel and so forth, just like we did in the TCP, so there's no misunderstanding there. Okay?

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
Yeah, we copy.

FLIGHT
Once you get them, TELMU.

58:44:22
CONTROL
That's Activation 40, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Activation 40, Jack.

58:45:31
CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. Do you want them to proceed with IMU fine align as outlined on page 40?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. That's what we want them to do.

FLIGHT
Affirm.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT. Did you up with those circuit breaker labels?

TELMU
FLIGHT, we're working on them right now.

FLIGHT
What do you mean? Don't you know what the circuit breaker numbers - names are?

58:46:00
TELMU
Yeah, there's a whole slew of them -

FLIGHT
Oh, okay.

TELMU
- what we're going to do is just give you a page of them with -

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
- breakers: open circled.

CAPCOM
Okay, I'm looking for panel - system - breaker name.

FLIGHT
Yeah, they're going to give you a picture of the panel with -

TELMU
We're just going to give you a picture -

FLIGHT
- them circled -

TELMU
- with the breakers circled.

CAPCOM
Beautiful.

CAPCOM
Do it just like TCP if you can.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
While you're doing that, have somebody else figuring out what we might take off here to save some current.

TELMU
Okay.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, same with you.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Same with you - we're going to want to save some power here, so -

CONTROL
Right. We're working on it.

FLIGHT
Figure out some suggestions.

58:47:31
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Jack, would you let me the conclusion of whatever discussions you guys had about - alignments? When you get - kind of one?

CAPCOM
Yessir.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Okay. I'll wait until you -

58:49:22
RECOVERY
FLIGHT, RECOVERY. Did you call?

FLIGHT
No.

58:50:39
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
Okay, we'd like to have an E-MOD DUMP for the LM, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
Yeah, we're ready for it at the site.

FLIGHT
Okay. We'll let - give them a little while, here.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
Okay, we're tracking a little problem here on ASCENT O₂ TANK 2 -

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, remind me of that in a little bit.

GUIDO
Yessir.

FLIGHT
ASCENT TANK 2, what is -

TELMU
The pressure is up higher than it should be, what we need to do is open ASCENT -

58:51:04
FLIGHT
Before you go through the valves, what are you trying to accomplish?

TELMU
We're trying to use the ASCENT TANK 2 pressure instead of the descent tank.

FLIGHT
Is it close to venting?

TELMU
No, it doesn't - it's not venting, yeah.

FLIGHT
Is it close to venting?

TELMU
It can't vent. Unless it's broken.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

TELMU
And it's not broken. Okay, what we're trying to do is relieve the pressure in that tank, so we want to close the DESCENT O₂ TANK VALVE and open ASCENT O₂ TANK 2.

FLIGHT
O₂, tank 2 - how high is it?

TELMU
It's up to 901.

FLIGHT
What's it at normally?

TELMU
Around 830.

FLIGHT
And you just want to use some of that and then we'll go back -

TELMU
That's right.

FLIGHT
- to normal configuration, huh?

FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, Jack?

CAPCOM
Okay -

58:52:00
FLIGHT
TANK 2 looks a little high, so they want to use some of it.

CAPCOM
Okay. I got that.

FLIGHT
ASCENT TANK 2 -

CAPCOM
Close the DESCENT O₂ and open ASCENT -

FLIGHT
O₂ tank number 2.

CAPCOM
Number 2; right.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is it a good idea to close the DESCENT O₂ VALVE now?

TELMU
Yeah, it's okay.

TELMU
He had to go that way, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I know that, but I'm worried about it coming back open.

TELMU
Okay, we copy.

58:53:06
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
FAO pointed out here - we are drifting around here on this middle gimbal angle - he's in MIN IMPULSE right now, and I'm assuming that's where he wants to be, but if he doesn't watch it close he can get himself into gimbal lock again real easy.

CONTROL
He's not in an automatic ATTITUDE HOLD mode right now, he's in a drifting flight mode.

FLIGHT
Yeah. He may be looking for stars -

CONTROL
Okay, but it might be worth a confirmation - okay, he knows that he's in there because he's hitting the ACA right now. Okay.

FLIGHT
Okay. How's he doing on the middle gimbal?

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
Alright. Is he away from it?

CONTROL
Yes.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, keep your eye on it, Hal. That's good.

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
Just sing out if you think he's getting close and we'll pass it up.

CONTROL
Roger.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
If you get a minute, I've got one little item here.

58:54:00
FLIGHT
Okay. How many amps are we taking out there - standby.

FLIGHT
Okay.

58:56:03
FLIGHT
CONTROL, did you have something for me?

CONTROL
Yes, sir. When we pressurized the RCS here, we noticed we got some - about 5 psi of change in the ASCENT OX and FUEL tank pressures - an increase, okay? We noticed that shortly thereafter. And what we'd like to do is to make sure they've got the ASCENT FEED VALVEs actually seated in the closed position. And when they get time, it'll - close two circuit breakers and cycle the switches for us to the closed position to make sure they are closed.

FLIGHT
Would you write down the procedure?

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Bring it over, please.

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
They're talking about display circuit breakers right now. We'll let that get settled.

CAPCOM
They're having to go up and look up some data books, but how about stowage-wise, FLIGHT? Do we have to worry about passing some gear back and forth? Maybe FAO ought to think about that.

FLIGHT
Bob? FAO? You got people working on that?

58:57:02
FAO
Say again, FLIGHT. Working on what?

FLIGHT
Stowage - what might want to get passed to the LM? Or from the LM to the CSM?

FAO
We'll have it.

FAO
FLIGHT, I've got -

58:58:12
CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, I have this abort PAD, and I've got some gimbal trim angles. Pitch and roll are - are these the ones that were preset, or are we going to have to jimmy these around?

FLIGHT
The preset ones probably were from docked. But let me check. RETRO?

FLIGHT
RETRO?

FLIGHT
FLIGHT.

RETRO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
These LM DPS trims, are they different than the ones in the vehicle right now?

RETRO
That's affirm. This is based on -

FLIGHT
Docked burn?

RETRO
- docked burn.

FLIGHT
And the ones they have on board are undocked, right?

RETRO
That's affirm. For PDI.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL. We've got some updates on those trims.

FLIGHT
Oh. Okay. Well, come on in with them.

CONTROL
Okay, I can give them to you right now.

CAPCOM
This is a coordination problem on these gimbal angles - I guess we're going to have to think of a procedure to coordinate the setting of those angles.

58:59:08
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you talking to me? I don't know what you mean -

CAPCOM
Affirm.

FLIGHT
- which gimbal angles?

CAPCOM
The DPS trim angles.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Okay, they can't - they can't read them out on board - set them on board. They have to run them and then have us verify down on the ground. Right?

FLIGHT
Yeah, well we can watch them trim it. I'm not sure I know what you're asking me, Jack.

CAPCOM
We're going to have to, say - tweak it a little more and then we're going to have to, say -

FLIGHT
No, they can trim it automatically, then load it. And run it through the program.

CAPCOM
But we have to verify because there's a different time that -

FLIGHT
Oh yeah. Yeah, we can verify the number.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
And we're getting some new ones, so hold up on those - GUIDANCE, you calling me?

GUIDO
Roger. The middle gimbal angle's getting big, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Getting close?

GUIDO
About 60 degrees.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have him watch his gimbal angle.

CAPCOM
Okay, I think I hear him doing that. What do you want him to do, just -

FLIGHT
Well, in case he hadn't noticed, it's getting close.

59:01:21
FLIGHT
Could I get the people in the room to be quiet?

FLIGHT
CAPCOM's talking.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM - standby, CAPCOM. Hey TELMU, he's talking.

CAPCOM
We have any on panel 16?

59:02:55
FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Hope you've got somebody working on a PTC procedure.

59:03:00
CONTROL
Right. We've already got one worked out, but it's an AGS-type procedure, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
That's okay.

FLIGHT
I say that, I'm not sure if I mean that - but okay.

CAPCOM
Got some angles?

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
The CAPCOM read up the circuit breakers to open on panel 11; I don't believe he turned the page over. There's some more of them. Panel 16 also.

FLIGHT
Just a minute, TELMU. RETRO and CONTROL, FLIGHT. The COAS angle you have N/A, are they not - are they not available?

FLIGHT
RETRO, FLIGHT.

RETRO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What does this N/A mean? For the COAS?

RETRO
GUIDO said it was not available.

FLIGHT
What do you mean, not available?

RETRO
Not - not applicable. He said not available.

RETRO
You might talk with GUIDO if you want more verification on that.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

59:04:00
FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Don't you want to add a COAS star to this PC+2? The CAPCOM asked why not.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, we'd have to know which axis that thing's mounted along right now.

FLIGHT
Okay. You don't have enough data to figure that out, is that right, right now?

GUIDO
Well, I don't know if he's got it mounted along the Z-axis or the X-axis, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. That's what I said. Okay.

FLIGHT
TELMU, write down what you want us to do, please, on the circuit breaker - I didn't hear you last time.

TELMU
The CAPCOM only read one side of that circuit breaker opening - we gave him a sheet, there's circuit breakers on panel 11 and 16 to open.

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
He only read up one side.

FLIGHT
He only read up panel 11?

TELMU
Yes.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We can go ahead and compute one for along the Z-axis and if it's not mounted there he can move it and mount the COAS over on the Z-axis.

59:05:01
FLIGHT
Okay. Go ahead.

GUIDO
Okay. We'll do that.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. You copying that?

CONTROL
Just caught the tail end of it.

FLIGHT
Do you see any venting in the LM?

59:06:03
CONTROL
Negative. We've got a lot of drops in and out of data.

FLIGHT
Okay. He's having some difficulty with it, so look for reasons why.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
It's 133 hours. To the AOL, to the Atlantic.

FLIGHT
You might let them know we're talking about that, too, Jack.

59:07:33
FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
We have a load, FLIGHT, but INCO says we can't COMMAND.

FLIGHT
Why not? INCO?

INCO
We can COMMAND if we go to LOW BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
Let's give them the numbers, then they'll punch in.

INCO
Sorry?

FLIGHT
Let's just give them the numbers to punch in.

GUIDO
We'll read it up to him, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

59:08:39
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
Okay, I've got this list of stuff here for this ascent feed.

FLIGHT
Okay. Bring it over. Have somebody hand it on.

CAPCOM
And FLIGHT, did we come up with something with regards to his - uplinking a time?

FLIGHT
We'll have trouble uplinking the time. We'd have to go to LOW BIT RATE - can he easily punch it in the DSKY there, GUIDANCE?

59:09:03
PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

PROCEDURES
Okay, stand by on that. We're trying an uplink mode that might give us COMMAND -

FLIGHT
Okay.

PROCEDURES
- and VOICE and HIGH BIT RATE.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go.

FLIGHT
For your information, the problem is that we've deviate some of the frequencies because of the proximity of the IU frequency, and that thing's still alive. Copy?

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
And that's - so it's a little bit nonstandard in that regard.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
But they're seeing what they can do. Why don't you give them a GET hack, though, eh? And let them know we're reading that VOX.

PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

PROCEDURES
Roger. We're on a COMMAND UPLINK mode along with VOICE, and we've got HIGH BIT RATE data.

FLIGHT
Okay. P00 and DATA and we can give him a time - wait a minute. GUIDANCE, you ready to give them a time?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We've got the LOAD.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
We're ready to go, Jack.

59:10:00
INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
He's got his UPDATA LINK OFF.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE. We've got the LOAD to go ahead and do it now.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I know. We've got another problem. Go ahead, INCO.

INCO
I think it would be better if we go to FORWARD OMNI on the LM now. This uplink.

FLIGHT
You want FORWARD OMNI?

INCO
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

INCO
Hurry.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you need to - going to need to get FORWARD OMNI in the LM.

59:11:00
INCO
I believe he's already done it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Oh, it's already done. Hm. Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, and he's going to write a mission time into the LGC.

FLIGHT
Can you do this when you don't have a DSKY? Time?

FLIGHT
That'll give him his clock, will it, RETRO?

RETRO
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Okay, if he wants to turn his inverters off, we can monitor his middle gimbal angle here for him. One other suggestion I have is that he -

FLIGHT
Wait, wait a minute. Let me - let me hear the COMM, here.

59:12:44
RETRO
FLIGHT, RETRO. We've got a good clock update.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
When we get a chance here, we'd like to take and change our offset on the two vehicles, on how we're getting telemetry, to try to solve this tracking problem. To do that we're going to have to drop the LM uplink and break lock for maybe 5 to 10, 20 seconds, there.

59:13:10
FLIGHT
Okay. Well, let's just standby on that a minute.

INCO
Okay.

FLIGHT
Okay. Now, before we get into that one -

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We'd like to have a VERB 74 some time when they can skip the DSKY.

FLIGHT
Okay, GUIDANCE. CAPCOM, we're ready for an E-MEMORY dump. They'll give us a VERB 74, that's what you're talking about, isn't it, GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We're getting an E-MEMORY dump.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. You saw an increase in the ascent tanks, is that right? Pressure?

CONTROL
Yes.

FLIGHT
And you want to be sure, what, that the ascent feeds are closed -

CONTROL
Yeah. Close those breakers and cycle those valves closed. Do not cycle to the open position, just to the close position.

59:14:03
CAPCOM (off loop)
- when he pressurized the -

FLIGHT
Yeah, RCS. And we want to do an E-MEMORY dump whenever they can get around to it, we're all ready to receive it.

CONTROL
Okay, I've got one item, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Say again?

CONTROL
This is CONTROL. We want to power down his inverters -

CAPCOM
Coming at you.

CONTROL
- and in order to do that, we're going to have to look at his middle gimbal angle for him on the ground. And to make it easier, he needs to get out of this MIN IMPULSE mode. He needs to go to - PGNS MODE CONTROL to AUTO when he gets to an attitude that he likes.

FLIGHT
That's - yeah. Okay.

FLIGHT
But now, wait a minute. Before we do any of that, I want to hear what it is control configuration we're going to be in, and whether we can keep the PGNS up or whether we're going to bring the AGS up, etc.

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
I want to get the holes dug before we start doing more things.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Let me see if - have you heard that one of the suggestions is to align the AGS to the PGNS, power the PGNS down, use the AGS, and then bring the PGNS back up and do a P52 for the burn?

59:15:08
CONTROL
That's right, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, I'd like to get that whole complex of control modes and what we're going to do in currents sorted out before we start changing things.

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
Or we'll be doing this all night. Okay, Hal?

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
And I'm open to any suggestions here as to what the reasonable course of action - the last I heard from -

FLIGHT
- staff is that they're going to try to run that again in the simulator, I believe.

CONTROL
Okay.

59:16:20
PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

PROCEDURES
Roger, we're going to have to write a RESTART. 10 second loss of data.

FLIGHT
Okay, everybody. Stand by for 10 second loss of data.

59:17:03
FLIGHT
- yeah. CONTROL, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Hal? CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Hal, Tom Stafford's coming over. Would you chat with him about this thing?

CONTROL
On the - PGNS/AGS?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CONTROL
Roger.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We got a good E-MOD, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. We got a good E-MOD. Do they need to terminate anything, GUIDANCE, or does it terminate? Oh, it terminates.

GUIDO
No, it's okay.

FLIGHT
Okay.

59:18:15
FLIGHT
And that's the Atlantic, too, Jack, for their info. That's the Atlantic.

FLIGHT
Yeah - we haven't made our mind we want to go there, but that's the PAD - that's the abort data he has in board.

FLIGHT
It's the minimum return.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
We'd like to send him a REFSMMAT sometime, FLIGHT. If he gives P00 and ACCEPT.

59:19:03
FLIGHT
What kind of REFSMMAT?

GUIDO
It's the one that they're aligned to. They were carrying one pre - prelaunch, and it's not the one that they're aligned to right now. We're going to give them the right matrix.

FLIGHT
Okay, and then what does he do? Align to it?

GUIDO
No, no. He's fine. We just need to get it in there.

FLIGHT
Oh, so he has it on board?

GUIDO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay. Okay, CAPCOM - are you ready to do that now?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you want to send them a state vector, too, by the way?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. We want to hold off on that.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
I'm not sure what the LM will do with it. We're having MIT run the hybrid, and see what it would do with this kind of -

FLIGHT
Oh, that's right, because it doesn't navigate out here.

GUIDO
That's right. So, we're having them run it on the hybrid, and check it out -

FLIGHT
The REFSMMAT - I'm not - GUIDANCE, say one more time why you want them to have a REFSMMAT, because he doesn't have one -

GUIDO
He doesn't have the one he's aligned to right now, FLIGHT -

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
- he aligned to the PTC and he was carrying another one.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Yeah. We want him to have the one he's aligned to.

GUIDO
And we're also going to stick a TFN in, FLIGHT.

59:20:03
CAPCOM
Alright, you want P00 and DATA now? You ready to go?

GUIDO
That's affirm. We're ready.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We're picking up.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go.

INCO
Can we try that procedure now?

FLIGHT
Just a minute, Ed. Let me see what else is cooking, I don't have any -

59:21:01
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
- reason why not to. Go ahead, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
We don't have the DUA. He gave us P00, but he didn't give us the DUA.

FLIGHT
Okay, we need the DATA position, right?

INCO
Roger.

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We got Program 00 but he needs to go to DATA first to get the load in.

FLIGHT
Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT -

INCO
That's probably what it is, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Yeah, they'll have to.

INCO
We've got it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
We're picking up, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT. We've got the VERB 74. CONTROL, FLIGHT, did you see him cycle the valves on the ascent feed?

59:22:05
CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Did he cycle the valves on the ascent feed? Jack says he did it.

CONTROL
Okay, we can't see that he did it, FLIGHT, on TM.

FLIGHT
Okay, but he did do it.

CONTROL
Okay, FLIGHT, thank you.

FLIGHT
Okay. He cycled the ascent feeds - -

FLIGHT
Okay, now, we're working on what we're going to do with the configuration. We need to get some kind of PTC going for us here, and we need to decide what we want to do with our control configuration - you're working all that, huh, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Trying my best to, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. We're coming up on AFT OMNI for the LM.

FLIGHT
Do you want us to switch now?

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
We're right in the middle of a load.

INCO
Okay, we'll - hold as long as we can.

INCO
He got it pretty quick on there anyway.

59:27:40
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
We're through COMMANDing to the LM.

FLIGHT
Through COMMANDing, CAPCOM.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
I'd like to go ahead and get that DUA off the line.

FLIGHT
Okay. We're through COMMANDing, CAPCOM, and they can take that circuit breaker - the DUA circuit breaker out again.

TELMU
And FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
We'd like to get as much gear off here as we can. We'd like for you to think about turning this inverter off.

59:28:06
FLIGHT
Again, here? Which inverter?

TELMU
The LM inverter. Inverter 2.

FLIGHT
It's running the eight-ball. Yeah, I need to tie that together with how we're going to fly this thing, Merlin - I'm waiting to get this whole thing.

TELMU
Understand, but -

FLIGHT
I understand what you're saying.

TELMU
Okay.

FLIGHT
How many amps are we taking with that?

TELMU
Well, we're pulling about 2 amps.

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
It'll run a little bit ??.

FLIGHT
Well, I know. I agree with you.

TELMU
Let me get -

FLIGHT
Let me - ah, okay.

TELMU
The water rate right now, we're pulling about 7 pounds per hour. And at current capabilities, about 34 hours. Descent water.

FLIGHT
Say again?

TELMU
About 34 hours on the descent water at the present rate.

FLIGHT
Oh, okay. Okay, but we should be able to take the PGNS and and the IMU off -

TELMU
That's right.

FLIGHT
- at some point.

59:29:11
FLIGHT
Okay. I'd like to get everybody up here a minute. RETRO, GUIDANCE, CONTROL, TELMU, GNC and EECOM, and CAPCOM. INCO and FAO. Is everybody on the loop, give me an amber, please.

FLIGHT
RETRO, you up?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, get RETRO up in the loop, will you please?

RETRO
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Look. As I see it, we've got a number of things to do. No big hurry right now. We've gotta maintain COMM here, of course, with the LM. But we need to see what we need to do about setting up a PTC attitude and an arrange - a control mode. And what that means relative to the AGS and the PGNS configuration as to powering the AGS down, etc. Now, CONTROL, you're working that problem, right?

CONTROL
Roger.

59:30:04
FLIGHT
And I'm proceeding now just staying put until we get that whole story put together - and how long is it going to take you, do you think, to come to some conclusion on that, Hal?

CONTROL
I don't have an estimate right now, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it to you as soon as -

FLIGHT
About an hour?

CONTROL
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Alright. Now, so - so we'll just standby on that. We are interested, though, in this also from the point of view of the power configuration. TELMU, I assume you're working out all the consumable options, and as soon as CONTROL's got a mode here you're going to be able to lay out a power profile to tell us where we stand on all your O₂, and your water, and your power, right?

TELMU
Wilco.

FLIGHT
But can you say something generally, now? Generally, we can come all the way home at 25 amps, right? On the LM?

TELMU
Not with this water usage right now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No, but if we go down to 25 amps all of that will help us, won't it?

59:31:00
FLIGHT
Oh, I see what you're saying. 25 amps - not much.

TELMU
Yeah, that's not going to help us that much, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, what do we have to get down to? For example?

TELMU
Standby - I would think about 15 amps or so.

FLIGHT
From the point of view of the water now we've got to get down there -

TELMU
Yeah. About 15, I think.

FLIGHT
Can we do that? In a life support/COMM mode?

TELMU
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
We could be at 15 amps in a life support/COMM mode, could we not?

TELMU
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
Alright. Now, we need to figure out something also for your CO₂ scrubbing, right?

TELMU
Right.

FLIGHT
And - and EECOM needs to - naw, he's going to do that over in his vehicle if we have to get into that. I've got a note up here that I don't quite understand, it says LM LiOH is 48 man-hours. That doesn't sound quite right to me.

TELMU
That's on the cartridge - standby, we'll get you consumables.

FLIGHT
Alright. But TELMU, I'd like some people to start running consumable profiles out, making a couple of different assumptions and not standing by, waiting for everything - and please have somebody run it out grossly, you know, so that we continue to have at least a story even though it's not the most accurate one; you can continue to refine it as you go along.

59:32:10
TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
I'd like to relatively soon here get some idea how we stand and what we're - boxes we're running into and when we've got to start deciding things, okay?

TELMU
Wilco.

FLIGHT
Okay, does anybody have anything else besides those areas that they want to bring to our attention right now?

INCO
INC - FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Yes. INCO.

INCO
If we can get that change done, we can get some tracking data for FDO, we'd hope. If you'll let us drop the uplink and the downlink from the LM for about 25 seconds.

FLIGHT
And then re-establish it?

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
We'd like you to alert the crew that they're not going to have contact for a few seconds.

FLIGHT
Okay. Let me go around, Ed, and then we'll pick that up. Does anybody have anything else? Let me go around the room. Trench - RETRO? FDO? GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, you okay? Well, go back green then, please. CONTROL, you got anything else?

59:33:00
CONTROL
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. TELMU?

TELMU
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. I want to start hearing from you, TELMU, on these consumables.

TELMU
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
I want to start hearing from you as you get some -

TELMU
Roger. We're cranking.

FLIGHT
Okay, go back green, then. GNC?

GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
EECOM?

EECOM
Negative.

FLIGHT
Green, please. CAPCOM, Jack, can you think of anything we ought to be working on other than those mentioned?

CAPCOM
I didn't get all you mentioned, but are we working on bringing the AGS up?

FLIGHT
Yeah, that's a possibility, you know? As to whether we gotta do that for the PTC, and do what Tom suggested here.

CAPCOM
Well, we could bring it up and have it there, and it'd be a good idea to make sure it's working.

FLIGHT
Yeah. I just don't want to use any more power right now, or any more water.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
As soon as we know a little more about what we really ought to do, then we'll proceed to spend the consumables to do that. Anything else that you can think of?

CAPCOM
I'd like to have a little more information upon the crew's trajectory with relation to the Moon that we could pass up.

59:34:00
FLIGHT
Yes, and INCO is gonna - at the end of this go-around the room, we're going to ask the crew to standby for about 25 seconds of COMM loss while we do some reconfiguring in an attempt to get tracking on the LM. Okay? But we still think they're close - FDO, FLIGHT? What -

FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What closest approach are you estimating right now on the LM?

FDO
Still looking at about 60 miles, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You're still looking at 60, Jack.

CAPCOM
60 miles.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
And -

FLIGHT
And this COMM thing we're going through is to try to re-establish tracking on the LM; right now, we don't have tracking.

CAPCOM
Okay, thank you.

FLIGHT
You can go back green, then, if you will. Okay - SURGEON, you have anything?

SURGEON
Yeah, two things. We're figuring, looking at this CO₂ problem with you - at what point in time we'd arrive at various levels of CO₂ in the LM configuration. The other thing is, when we - at some point in time we'd like to get that BIOMED switch on in the LM - it's in the OFF position.

59:35:02
FLIGHT
Okay. Okay, you want to go back green, then? INCO, anything besides that COMM -

FLIGHT
INCO, anything else? Go back green, then. AFD?

AFD
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
FAO, you have anything you're working on - that's stowage, right?

FAO
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Any suggestions we might have as to what they might move to the LM, or move to the CSM.

FAO
That's right. We're working on that. I think it'll be minimal anyway.

FLIGHT
Okay. And NETWORK, you got anything?

NETWORK
Well, we hope to have Honeysuckle 210 up by 62 hours for voice only.

FLIGHT
Okay.

NETWORK
We hope to have them up by then.

FLIGHT
Okay. RECOVERY? You got anything?

RECOVERY
Negative, FLIGHT. Present efforts are to identify ships on the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.

FLIGHT
Okay. NETWORK, you want to go back green, then? Okay, there are the subjects, and we need to start getting some - closed out on some of them here, gentlemen. So. Let us bend our efforts to get that done.

59:36:05
INCO
Got a GO, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Yeah. CAPCOM, would you call the crew and tell them we're going to drop COMM for half a minute here while we try to establish tracking?

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
And let them know that our best estimate of the EC's got a 60 mile perigee right now.

INCO
And FLIGHT, if you'll confirm AFT OMNI.

FLIGHT
And you want AFT OMNI?

INCO
Affirm.

FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?

59:37:01
FLIGHT
Okay, INCO. We've told them. Go ahead.

INCO
Thank you, FLIGHT.

59:39:51
(note)
<< An off-loop conversation is partially caught here, which appears to pertain to powering some elements of the CSM off the LM, possibly to use its life support system. Additional conversation discusses a burn - possibly the one that occurs in the final chapter of this audio to bring the crew back onto a free-return trajectory to Earth as soon as possible, rather than waiting until PC+2 at 79 hours. >>

59:41:38
FLIGHT
EECOM, you copy that?

EECOM
That sounds okay here, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay with us, Jack.

EECOM
We agree with all of that.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
As a matter of fact, Jack, why don't you let them know that we're currently - since it's so quiet from here - trying to figure out what's the best configuration to do here relative to maintaining control, maintaining some kind of PTC, staying in the posture that we can do the burn properly, and playing that against the consumables. And as soon as we get a reasonably coherent story we'll brief them in full on it. Okay?

59:42:26
CAPCOM
Okay. How about - are we getting a flight plan worked out, modified, so forth?

FAO
We are working on that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah, working on it. And you might also tell them that we've got Gene Cernan and the guys over in the simulator checking stars, etc, in this configuration.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
And anything that they would like us to run, we can proceed to do it.

59:43:03
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
TELMU, let me hear the COMM. Okay? Can we hear it? Do you need something?

TELMU
We've got to power down, here, pretty quick.

FLIGHT
Okay. TELMU, go.

TELMU
We ought to - recommend turning the power off - POWER AMPL off, going to LOW BIT RATE, and getting his AC off, and probably bringing the AGS up on standby.

FLIGHT
Okay. What consumable are you running into trouble with, TELMU?

TELMU
Water and electric power.

FLIGHT
Okay. Can you relate some facts to me, here?

TELMU
Like I said, the water is - present rate, we've only got 34 hours left.

FLIGHT
Go ahead. Power?

59:44:00
TELMU
Standby 1.

TELMU
Okay, the power is 67.5 hours, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is that ascent and descent?

TELMU
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
At the present load, is that right?.

TELMU
That's right.

TELMU
That's what I - I think we just need to get some things powered down ASAP.

FLIGHT
Okay. Now what are you suggesting, again?

TELMU
I'm suggesting POWER AMPL -

FLIGHT
POWER AMPL. How much does that save?

TELMU
- and LOW BIT RATE - that's about 2.5 amps.

FLIGHT
Alright.

TELMU
And the AC, which is about 2 amps.

FLIGHT
Well, that loses his ball; then we don't have anything. Right? I mean, we don't have the data on the ground - do you have IMU data on the LOW BIT RATE there, CONTROL?

59:45:01
CONTROL
All we'd have is resolvers. It's good enough.

FLIGHT
You can watch it?

CONTROL
Yeah, we can watch the gimbal angle.

FLIGHT
What control mode is he in now?

CONTROL
He's in PGNS MIN IMPULSE.

FLIGHT
So he's still flying it around.

CONTROL
Yes.

FLIGHT
I think it's kind of difficult to talk them through, isn't it?

FLIGHT
He'd have to bring the ball up to fly it, I'd think.

TELMU
Well, my thought if we go there, FLIGHT, was if he goes to an ATTITUDE HOLD mode now, and out of this drifting flight mode, he'll hold the attitude he's in now.

CONTROL
Okay, then you don't have to worry about it.

FLIGHT
Was that what you want to start - recommend, and EECO - TELMU's getting in a hurry, here.

CONTROL
Yeah, well, I don't blame him.

CAPCOM
What's going on with the COMMs, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
I don't know.

FLIGHT
What else, TELMU, have you got anything else to suggest?

TELMU
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Now, how about you? What can you do to help? What do we need to do to decide whether to go to the AGS or not, here?

59:46:05
CONTROL
Well -

FLIGHT
Do we know whether or not the - results of this star business in the simulator worked?

CONTROL
That was a request I've got in to SPAN, FLIGHT, to measure drift rates on this particular platform to see what it would look like when we got out to 79 and a half hours.

FLIGHT
Okay. But if we can see stars, we can do a P52.

CONTROL
Yes, if he can see the stars, then that kind of falls out, you know? And if that - if he can do a 52 align we'd definitely recommend to transfer the alignment into the AGS and turn the AGS on, turn the PGNS down.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go.

FLIGHT
What are you getting out of the star sighting discussions?

CAPCOM
Well, the last thing I heard was that the sunlight reflected off the thrusters - made it so as they couldn't see the stars and they also had a lot of debris still floating around with them, so they are unable to -

FLIGHT
Couldn't see them out of what? Out of the window? Or out of the AOT?

CAPCOM
Out of the window.

FLIGHT
Have they tried the AOT yet, do you know? The reason I'm asking is that we're running low on water. I mean, we're going to run out of water in 34 hours at the current power level.

59:47:36
FLIGHT
How about going to LOW BIT RATE? The POWER AMPL OFF and the LOW BIT RATE? CONTROL? Can you do that now?

CONTROL
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, can you do that now?

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
INCO, okay with you?

FLIGHT
INCO?

INCO
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Okay with you if we turn the POWER AMPL OFF and go to LOW BIT RATE?

INCO
Well, why don't you let us get ourselves swung in, here, and see how we're going to work out with this problem? We're -

FLIGHT
What just happened?

INCO
- in the midst of that procedure, there.

FLIGHT
Oh, okay. You're still in the middle of that.

59:48:00
INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
I don't have any COMM with them, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
INCO, FLIGHT. Do we have no uplink right now?

FLIGHT
How come? We still - I thought that was only going to take 30 seconds.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. I don't think he's got an uplink COMM mode right now.

FLIGHT
Well, can we get one?

INCO
Yeah, he's coming through right in that spot that I told you about, there. We're trying to force that lock now, and as soon as we get it we'll give you a call.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Are we tracking them yet, FLIGHT?

INCO
For reference, going to POWER AMPL OFF on an OMNI in LOW BIT RATE -

59:49:00
FLIGHT
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Ed. The CAPCOM wants to know when we're going to have COMM. Is it coming back shortly?

INCO
I'll give you a call. It'll be back shortly.

FLIGHT
Alright. Okay, now the POWER AMPL.

INCO
If we turn the POWER AMPL OFF, go to LOW BIT RATE and stay on an OMNI, if we go to DOWN VOICE BACKUP; we may be able to make it. It'll be very close.

FLIGHT
Make what?

INCO
Voice.

FLIGHT
Up or down?

INCO
Both.

INCO
It's going to be marginal.

INCO
I'd like to give it a try, though.

FLIGHT
Okay, well let's finish up your test. Are you finished with that test?

INCO
No, they're not quite finished yet. Standby.

59:50:14
FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Merlin, I've got your problem, and I appreciate your concern. Right now we're trying to get the COMM back - we kind of have to get his assessment of this thing to see whether we can bring the PGNS down now.

TELMU
Okay. What about the AC? Did - you still kicking that around?

FLIGHT
Well, that's a problem. I don't know what we're going to do for PTC yet. I'm waiting for CONTROL. Without the - we can't just sit there in ATTITUDE HOLD. And I don't know about setting up a PTC in the LM.

TELMU
Okay.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Are his attitudes moving around some? Or is he essentially fixed?

59:51:03
CONTROL
Essentially static in attitude.

CONTROL
He's moving just a little bit but not a heck of a lot.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Sup - go ahead.

TELMU
This ASCENT TANK 2 pressure has gone back down to a nominal value. We'd like to go back to the DESCENT O₂.

FLIGHT
Okay.

TELMU
Close TANK 2 and open DESCENT TANK.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAP - INCO, are we anywhere near back in COMM yet?

INCO
FLIGHT, if you just hang on a couple of more seconds here, maybe we can get this thing squared away so we get the tracking data that FDO needs. That's what we're after, here.

59:52:06
FLIGHT
I understand that.

INCO
No, we're not - we don't have a good COMM mode at this time.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, when you get COMM back, we can go back to DESCENT O₂. You got that, Jack?

FLIGHT (off loop)
Is it the same procedure?

FLIGHT
GNC and CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
CONTROL here.

59:53:00
FLIGHT
Is somebody working me out a PTC procedure?

CONTROL
Yeah, we're trying to get one before they go. We've got one for the AGS right now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
It looks like we're getting it slowly, here. We're just about there. As soon as you get it, we'd like to go to FORWARD OMNI.

FLIGHT
Okay.

59:54:14
FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Merlin, how many amps are we using with the LGC and the IMU?

TELMU
Just about 12 amps.

FLIGHT
Total?

TELMU
Yeah.

TELMU
It's 10 amps, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Total. So we still have about 20 amps, huh?

TELMU
Yeah.

FLIGHT
But they're the - they would be the big coolant items, wouldn't they? 

TELMU
Yeah -

FLIGHT
That ought to improve the coolant picture a heck of a lot more than 30 percent.

TELMU
Yup.

59:55:40
FLIGHT
INCO, can we talk yet?

NETWORK
That's a negative, FLIGHT. There's no uplink.

FLIGHT
INCO, have I got an estimate?

INCO
FLIGHT, let me tell you what's happened. While we were trying to lock it up, we've drifted around into FORWARD OMNI country. So right now we're in FORWARD OMNI, we've got AFT selected, and he doesn't know because -

59:56:01
FLIGHT
How so?

INCO
- he has his display breaker pulled. So if I can bear on your indulgence to wait until we swing all the way around to the AFT OMNI, then we can get this -

FLIGHT
We're not exactly swinging, you know?

INCO
Yes, we are, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Are we? We moving around?

INCO
We sure are.

FLIGHT
Like this? As far as you can -

INCO
No, like this.

FLIGHT
Pitch? Kind of?

INCO
Roll. LM Yaw.

FLIGHT
Command Module roll.

INCO
Look at channel 32.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay, well - I don't know how to read that one. Is that roll?

CONTROL
FLIGHT, we are pitching right now.

FLIGHT
Pitching, you said.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
60 degrees, now.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Well, wait a minute. You guys have data? We should - should we be able to get through then, on the COMM?

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you should - INCO, do you think we've got COMM now?

INCO
Give it a try, and get him to say FORWARD OMNI if he shows anything.

FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM.

59:57:01
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
I'll come up a minute.

FLIGHT
Come ahead, Merlin.

INCO
Jack, say FORWARD OMNI.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, as soon as you get a hold of him, would you get him to say what he wants to say about the starfield? And you can tell him to go back to the DESCENT O₂. CONTROL, from FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
I'm becoming convinced that we don't have any choice here, but that we've got to go to some kind of AGS mode, here.

CONTROL
That's right; I'm taking the procedure now.

FLIGHT
Okay. You getting it all written up?

CONTROL
I'm getting it - partly out of the Activation checklist.

59:58:00
FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
The - procedure - procedure is available from these - from CONTROL for the AGS PTC, and I think we're running out of choices. We're probably just going to have to -

INCO
CAPCOM, you might try it now.

59:59:03
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have you - have you got them yet?

CAPCOM
No, I haven't got them yet.

FLIGHT
There he is. Okay, everybody. Here's COMM.

FLIGHT
It's probably due to our configuration.

INCO
FORWARD OMNI.

FLIGHT
And we need FORWARD OMNI.

60:00:05
INCO
Okay.

CAPCOM
He's been on it, and he is on FORWARD OMNI, and the COMM has a lot of background noise from Houston.

FLIGHT
Okay. What can we do, INCO?

INCO
Okay, let me just try one more thing, we'll be with you.

FLIGHT
Alright. Hurry.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Look. When we get them, you get the O₂ business straightened out. But tell them that we have to, very soon, decide to bring the AGS up, and do things with that.

60:01:04
FLIGHT
INCO -

FLIGHT
INCO, FLIGHT. What are we getting?

FLIGHT
What are we getting?

FLIGHT
INCO, FLIGHT. Are we going to get COMM back? I'm going to knock off the tracking here in a minute. That 30 second -

INCO
That's - FLIGHT, we're -

FLIGHT
- test has run too long.

60:02:01
INCO
Right. We're going back to the normal mode. Standby.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, you write -

TELMU
And close ASCENT.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, does he have anything to say about stars and P52 yet?

CAPCOM
No, I haven't heard any word. I can't ask him a question because he can't read me.

60:03:00
FLIGHT
Yeah. INCO, have we reconfigured yet?

INCO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We reconfigured yet?

INCO
Negative.

FLIGHT
How long?

INCO
No estimate. I'll get it for you soon as we can.

INCO
FLIGHT, we have a 2 minute estimate.

FLIGHT
Okay.

60:04:39
INCO
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
It was us, Jack.

FLIGHT
It was the ground configuration.

60:05:32
INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. We need AFT OMNI.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. AFT OMNI.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, AFT OMNI.

60:06:03
FAO
And FLIGHT, FAO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FAO
If he wants to try the method John's been talking about, we can give them an attitude to go to.

INCO
FLIGHT, that's the IU frequency. Just say AFT OMNI and we'll be in there, I think.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. How are you doing?

CONTROL
We're just about there, FLIGHT, on this AGS turn-on procedure.

FLIGHT
Okay. Okay.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
Can we go ahead and get the POWER AMPL off?

FLIGHT
I'm afraid to do anything to the COMM right now, until we have this discussion with them about what we want them to do, Merlin.

FLIGHT
- I sure do. And I want to get it off as bad as you do.

60:07:00
TELMU
Right.

FLIGHT
Can - TELMU, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is there much of a difference to you to operate on the AGS, with the PGNS down? Water-wise?

CAPCOM
Are they still on FORWARD OMNI?

TELMU
Well, it's about - about 3 amps, but primarily the AGS does run a little cooler, and you'd be bringing up a new piece of gear. So, it'd be a different thermal load, there.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Well, I want to get into this configuration and try it.

TELMU
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Has he said anything about the stars yet? Jack?

60:08:00
CAPCOM
No, he hasn't. We can't even ask him a good question. Is he still on FORWARD OMNI?

FLIGHT
FORWARD OMNI, INCO?

INCO
No. AFT OMNI, FLIGHT.

INCO
But you're not going to get through.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
They're having trouble grabbing ahold of the S-IVB to push it out of the way, is what the problem is.

FLIGHT
Okay, well, we had COMM before. Can we get back to there?

INCO
That's what they're trying to do. We're not having any luck. There's one suggestion we can do. We can turn the LM transceiver completely off for about 2 to 3 minutes, and let them grab ahold of the S-IVB, push it out of the way, and then bring it back up.

FLIGHT
Is that what we have to do now? We can't talk to them to tell them to do that.

INCO
That's right. But if we can get up ?? here, just say: "turn your transceiver off for 3 minutes. Then turn it back on." And I'll try to give you a call if I think you can get through.

FLIGHT
Okay.

60:09:13
FLIGHT
What's the proper terminology over there? On the switch.

CAPCOM
You want the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER?

INCO
TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER to OFF. Panel 12.

FLIGHT
For 3 minutes.

CAPCOM
You want S-BAND XMTR/RCVR OFF?

FLIGHT
Is that our best step here, INCO?

FLIGHT
INCO, FLIGHT. Is that our best step to get COMM back?

FLIGHT
INCO, FLIGHT.

INCO
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Is that our best step now to get COMM back?

INCO
That's our best step. Right.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, give them that. We'll try.

INCO
He's not going to hear you, FLIGHT, right now.

60:10:07
FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
Now, how close are you to having this thing - you're proposing an AGS PTC mode and a -

CONTROL
Well, we just got input - what I'm going to do you - with right now, is a procedure for turning the AGS on and aligning it to the PGNS, so we can turn the PGNS off.

FLIGHT
Yes.

CONTROL
And that'll leave us in an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD mode.

FLIGHT
Yes.

CONTROL
And I just got word from SPAN, the procedure we had for the PTC in AGS, Carlton Hanaway (??) has been, he's - it's not going to work. He's working feverishly to get one that will. Just got that input.

CONTROL
You might be able to handle it without the PTC, saves the attitude that we at - are now at, and then just change attitudes over some time schedule.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Do you recommend we simulate this procedure over in the LMS before we ship it up?

FLIGHT
Which procedure, Jack? What we're proposing is an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD that we change periodically.

60:11:04
FLIGHT
Since they don't have a PTC, as such, that works.

CAPCOM
Well, that's what I mean -

FLIGHT
Yes.

CAPCOM
- we've got a procedure that will give us PTC in AGS, try it in the simulator first.

FLIGHT
They - they don't have a procedure to get a PTC in AGS. They had one -

CONTROL
We had one -

FLIGHT
- it doesn't work.

CONTROL
- but it doesn't work. Somebody thinks it won't, so we're not going to try it. Unless you want to try that one, there.

CAPCOM
??

CONTROL
I would say no on that.

60:13:00
INCO
They're trying to bring up an uplink carrier to the LM so we can get them voice down.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FDO
I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here. 

FLIGHT
Say again?

FDO
I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here. Looking at a maneuver in the vicini - in the present time range, and on the vector that I've got now, looking at about 16 feet per second to get free-return.

FLIGHT
Yeah; that's what I'm hearing over here in my other ear, Bill.

FDO
Alright. And, I've got the selects down here working on a vector right now. This is on the CSM doppler after the glitches.

FLIGHT
Mmhmm.

60:14:00
FDO
And we're not sure whether it's going to be any better than what we've got now.

FLIGHT
Uh huh.

FDO
So, I guess what I've got to say is that in about 10 minutes, I can have a maneuver ready - I'll be able to compute a maneuver; time range of 61:30. And we can make that decision with that - ∆V will be around, like I said, about 16 or 17 feet per second.

FLIGHT
And that's a free-return.

FDO
That's affirm. So you can work with that number.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
Okay, we've got a good G&N now, if we - probably get a real good burn off now. Go ahead and do it with this good G&N - 

FLIGHT
Uh huh.

GUIDO
- get a free-return.

60:15:59
FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT.

60:16:00
FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Can we - how long would it take you to get a free-return maneuver - could you get one at 61 hours?

FDO
Roger that. I can. It's just a question of which vector we want to do it on, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well, get one at 61 on the best vector you have.

FDO
Roger that.

60:17:15
FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT - TELMU, FLIGHT.

EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Merlin, how much water does it cost us to keep the PGNS up for another hour?

TELMU
How much water -

FLIGHT
You got an hourly rate on it?

TELMU
Standby.

60:18:15
INCO
FLIGHT, I think you've got COMM.

FLIGHT
Jack, we have COMM.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

TELMU
Just about - cost you about 3 pounds of water.

FLIGHT
3 pounds of water to keep it up for another hour.

TELMU
Right.

FLIGHT
Out of how many pounds?

TELMU
About 230.

FLIGHT
That's - seems to me to be worth it.

?? (off loop)
Yeah, right, I think we gotta keep it up.

TELMU
Okay.

?? (off loop)
Keep it up through the maneuver and then power it down -

FLIGHT
Yup. Then power it down, let it drift, and we'll do what we want to tomorrow.

TELMU
Okay, but can we go ahead and turn the POWER AMPL off?

60:19:00
FLIGHT
POWER AMPL. What will that do to my COMM?

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
We lost it again. Standby.

FLIGHT
Gentlemen, we're going to proceed to do a free-return maneuver here. At 61 hours, assume that; as soon as we get COMM with the crew we'll see how they feel about doing it there. It's going to be about 16 feet a second, Jack. We want to get on a free-return so we can get powered down. And we'll still kick it at PC+2, if - all - if we can get everything back up and aligned properly. But, with the way it is, we want to get back on free-return; cost us an hour's time here with the PGNS powered up, that's 3 pounds of water and we'll spend that. Okay?

FLIGHT
Now, FDO, get me a PAD, pronto.

FDO
Copy.

FLIGHT
And we'll run a couple of them in case we get behind on time, here. GUIDANCE, what do we need - how do we need to burn this thing? We don't have a vector in there; it's not going to be a guided burn, is it?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, I'm going to MIT run it in a hybrid and see if it can take a vector, if it'll work alright -

60:20:01
FLIGHT
If it can't, how do we do it?

GUIDO
- that's what I'm working on right now. If it can't, we'll do it in ATTITUDE HOLD. P47.

FLIGHT
Alright. I think that's the way we want to do it anyway, that mode will get you all that -

GUIDO
Yeah, that's what we know will work right now, I think. But we're going to look at the other.

FLIGHT
INCO, let me know as soon as we get COMM, will you?

INCO
Roger.

FLIGHT
INCO, what do you think my chances are getting COMM back here shortly are?

INCO
Starting to look a little better here, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. FDO, you got an estimate on that PAD?

60:21:01
FDO
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
You got an estimate on that PAD?

FDO
5 minutes, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

FLIGHT
And while you're at it, and get - while you get that one out, run a couple more at 15 minute increments. Run one at 60:45, and run one at 61:15, etc. Okay?

FDO
Copy.

FLIGHT
But get the 61 hour one out pronto.

FDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. You copying me?

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We're going to do a little burn here, 16 feet a second and get back on free-return -

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
- as soon as we can get COMM, we're shooting for 61 hours.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE is doing something to see how the equations are going to work, but I'm inclined to say we ought to do it in ATT HOLD PGNS. Consider that, and consider everything else you want to think about and tell me any changes you'd want to make. And where we ought to pick up the checklist, etc; and let's refer to the - as best we can from the pilot's books, Hal. Tell them where to pick up from where they are now.

60:22:02
CONTROL
Roger.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
It looks like you've got it.

FLIGHT
COMM, Jack. Okay, everybody, let's be quiet. We have COMM. We've got a lot of business to do.

60:23:29
FLIGHT
Figure something out.

FLIGHT
After the midcourse.

60:24:15
FLIGHT (off loop)
No, I don't - wait a minute!

FLIGHT
We can give them another 15 minute if - yeah, we can give another - get a suggestion from him. We can figure it out whenever he wants it.

FLIGHT
Get a suggested Tig time from him, Jack, that he's comfortable with. Yeah, it's not going to cost us much water.

60:25:00
FLIGHT
FDO, stand by on a Tig time.

FLIGHT
61:20. Is that okay? 61:25.

CAPCOM
How about 61:30?

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
That's right.

FLIGHT
Okay, FDO. You got that Tig?

FDO
Go, FLIGHT. FLIGHT, FDO.

CONTROL
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
FDO, you got the Tig time?

FDO
Copy. 61 +30.

FLIGHT
Okay. Proceed.

60:26:40
FLIGHT
Okay.

60:27:14
FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, I don't think he ought to do any special maneuvering to find this out right now, do you? Don't talk them into that.

FLIGHT
Okay. Let's concentrate on the burn.

60:28:23
FLIGHT
I didn't hear all of his question. John?

CAPCOM
How much can he use the TTCA?

FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT. Have you got tracking on the LM?

FDO
Standby, FLIGHT.

FDO
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Are you seeing anything? He's using his translation controller for attitude control. With the stack. You understand?

FDO
Accurate.

FLIGHT
And now are you seeing that in the trajectory? Have you got a good, solid trajectory?

FDO
I'll check now.

60:29:02
FLIGHT
GNC, FLIGHT - CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
CONTROL here.

FLIGHT
GNC?

GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Consider doing a 16 foot-a-second with the Command Module RCS. Service Module RCS - tell me what that means to me.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, he's wanting us to follow him through on the 2-hour activation. And so I want some people -

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
- standing by to go with it on me.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, TELMU, GUIDANCE. FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go.

TELMU
Go.

FLIGHT
Stand by on the loop here -

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- we're going to follow through the activation.

TELMU
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, are we - down through 1. Step 1 on page 1.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
I'd like you to ask him to manage the OMNIs as he's talking.

FLIGHT
Does he have his meter up?

INCO
Yeah, it seems as though he still has that display breaker in, so the meter must be up.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
It appears from my CAL curve that he's up.

60:30:01
CAPCOM
Okay. Let's go. He's gotta hurry to get this 2-hour Activation done in 1 hour. So why don't we -

FLIGHT
Okay, everybody. Quiet in the room, please, and let's walk through with Jack on the Activation. Everybody got their book out, ready to follow. CONTROL, TELMU -

CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- GUIDANCE. Go, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay. We're on page 1, step 1. And he's going to be talking back.

TELMU
TELMU. Concur.

TELMU
Concur. Okay.

60:31:12
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, TELMU.

TELMU
Okay, we do not want to INVERTER 1 CLOSED.

FLIGHT
You what?

FLIGHT
Say again, TELMU?

TELMU
We do not want INVERTER 1 breaker CLOSED in step 5, here.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we do not want INVERTER 1 circuit breaker CLOSED in step 5. Do not.

TELMU
And omit step 6.

FLIGHT
And omit step 6.

60:32:16
TELMU
Roger.

TELMU
FLIGHT, we recommend leaving the caution/warning off.

FLIGHT
Caution - recommend that, huh? He says recommend leaving caution and warning off, Jack.

TELMU
We got the time.

60:33:02
TELMU
We got the time, here.

FLIGHT
You got it?

TELMU
We got it.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Okay, on step 1 did I understand he left the - that he did close ENGINE CONTROL breaker?

FLIGHT
What is your question?

CONTROL
Did he activ - did he close the ENGINE CONTROL breaker under item 1, page 3? Last entry.

FLIGHT
I don't know.

RETRO
FLIGHT, RETRO.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. We need AFT OMNI.

RETRO
FLIGHT, RETRO.

FLIGHT
Can you wait a minute, RETRO?

60:34:03
FLIGHT
Satisfied, CONTROL?

CONTROL
That's not it, FLIGHT. That's not it.

INCO
AFT OMNI, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
And we need an AFT OMNI, Jack. We'll lose COMM.

CONTROL
We got it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Roger.

CAPCOM
Okay, you want the circuit breaker -

FLIGHT
Okay. Copy these, guys.

TELMU
That's good.

60:35:03
CONTROL
Break, break.

FLIGHT
Okay. Have him standby right there, Jack. What is it, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Okay. On row 1, we need -

FLIGHT
Circle it, and we'll get it at the end.

60:36:43
FLIGHT
Okay, standby, we have a comment. CONTROL, you have a comment.

CONTROL
Yes, on row 1, DECA GIMBAL under AC BUS A needs to be closed.

CAPCOM
Hey, there's a lot of breakers that aren't closed that we have called out in the checklist here. Do you want them to close all of it - outline?

60:37:07
CONTROL
We'll catch the DECA POWER later on.

CONTROL
We'll catch that later.

FLIGHT
We'll remind him of that later.

CONTROL
It's in the procedure.

FLIGHT
It'll come up in the procedure later, Jack.

CAPCOM
How about the rest of these breakers? You want them to close them and open them as outlined in the checklist, here, or you going to have them hold up? Looks like we're going to screw up our procedure here if we don't do it just the way it's outlined.

FLIGHT
I didn't hear you, Jack, I was getting other input.

??? (off loop)
They're really going to give you a lot of data you don't need - displays and stuff you're not going to get.

CAPCOM (off loop)
You rather -

FLIGHT (off loop)
Yes.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Yes.

CAPCOM (off loop)
- they're supposed to be in that are not now in -

FLIGHT (off loop)
Yes.

CAPCOM (off loop)
- aren't we going to call those out now?

FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, do you want these that aren't closed to be closed?

FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL?

60:38:00
TELMU
No. TELMU.

FLIGHT
Say again?

TELMU
Negative from TELMU.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, how about you?

CONTROL
Negative from us, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Well, why are you saying that? Why don't we just do it by the book?

CONTROL
Well - that's the quickest thing in my mind, to do it - just do it by the book.

FLIGHT
Well, why aren't we doing that?

CONTROL
Well. It may take a little more power than what we need - than what we've got to spare.

FLIGHT
Well, I'm willing to spend that right now.

CONTROL
Okay.

CAPCOM
Use the reviewed procedures? We want to -

FLIGHT
Yeah. I think we'd better stick with what we know works.

CAPCOM
- I think we ought to stick to the procedure as-written.

FLIGHT
Yup. I agree, Jack. Let's go ahead.

CAPCOM
You want me to tell them to push them in as -

FLIGHT
As on the list.

CAPCOM
- outlined on the checklist.

FLIGHT
Yes. I don't want to take any chances with this.

60:39:19
FLIGHT
Okay, everybody, stick with him now. We're going to be moving on to the next steps.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT. I want you to have somebody looking ahead. We're going to do this burn in P47. Right?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, I don't think we can do it in 47. I don't think we have TVC control in 47.

FLIGHT
What are we going to do it in?

GUIDO
We'll have to do it in 40.

FLIGHT
It doesn't - do we know it works?

GUIDO
We're having MIT run it.

FLIGHT
We have to get them a vector then, up. Do we?

GUIDO
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
I don't really care for that - that's all we can do?

GUIDO
Well, we haven't talked to CONTROL about using the AGS possibly.

FLIGHT
The AGS are not up!

60:40:00
CONTROL
The AGS's not up, and that's strictly a manual operation - that'd be even worse than a 47, probably.

CAPCOM
The procedure as written calls for P40.

FLIGHT
Yeah. The concern, Jack, is that the LM computer, with these funny vectors, we have to verify, see -

CONTROL
Yes.

GUIDO
Leave the RCS TCAs in.

FLIGHT
Yes.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
When will the answer come in if it's okay - when are you going to put a vector in, etc?

GUIDO
They're on schedule right now for 61:30?

FLIGHT
Yes.

GUIDO
Okay. We'll - roger. We've got a vector, I think now, that we could go ahead and - but let's standby to get - see if we could get an answer here in the next few minutes. It might be close to there on the hybrid right now.

FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. When am I going to get the answer? Do they know I need it in - you know, 10 or 15 minutes?

GUIDO
Yes, FLIGHT.

60:41:00
FLIGHT
We don't have all night.

GUIDO
They know you need it.

FLIGHT
Alright.

CAPCOM
Okay. And now we can go through this list and see if there are a couple odds and ends we can yank out. Like the tape recorders, he suggests.

FLIGHT
Okay with the tape recorders, TELMU?

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
Yes.

CAPCOM
Any others like that?

FLIGHT
Anything else that's essentially trivial?

CONTROL
We'd recommend opening the RENDEZVOUS RADAR HEATER -

TELMU
They're already opened.

CONTROL
- and the LGC. LANDING - excuse me, LANDING RADAR.

FLIGHT
Yeah, that's open too.

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
All we've got, then, is the recorder, Jack. We agree with that. The others are all okay.

CAPCOM
Okay.

60:42:14
FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
While you're doing that, could you have somebody work with GUIDANCE on - even without TVC, if we trim this gimbal up right, and don't throttle up for 40 feet a second, we ought to be able to have a pretty good controlled burn.

CONTROL
That's right.

FLIGHT
Work that problem in case thing from MIT comes out negative.

CONTROL
Okay. You talking about doing it in 47?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CONTROL
Okay.

CAPCOM
How about VHF A and B? We want that left off?

INCO
Off.

FLIGHT
VHF A and B.

INCO
Off.

FLIGHT
Off.

CAPCOM
OPEN?

INCO
OPEN, yes.

FLIGHT
OPEN.

60:43:05
INCO
Negative.

FLIGHT
Negative.

INCO
When we need it - when we want it we'll tell him.

FLIGHT
Leave it OPEN; we'll call for it when we want it.

60:44:18
FLIGHT
PROCEDURES, FLIGHT.

PROCEDURES
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
61:30.

PROCEDURES
Roger that. Thank you.

FLIGHT
You're squeaking.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT, they're going back over the panel, are they? Okay.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, TELMU, and GUIDANCE, and INCO.

CONTROL
CONTROL here.

FLIGHT
Look ahead a little bit, now, in this thing, and anticipate what you want to be deleted.

GUIDO
Roger.

CONTROL
Negative. Not - negative on the PQGS. Standby.

FLIGHT
Negative on the PQGS. We're checking the REGs.

60:45:04
CONTROL
And negative on the ASCENT HELIUM REGs.

FLIGHT
And how about the SYSTEM ENGINEER X-POINTER?

CONTROL
X-POINTER negative.

FLIGHT
X-POINTER negative.

TELMU
Roger.

TELMU
Negative.

FLIGHT
TELMU, you said no, didn't you?

TELMU
Negative.

FLIGHT
Negative.

FLIGHT
FAO, let me how we're doing on time, will you? How are we doing?

FAO
Roger, FLIGHT, we will. Standby.

60:46:00
FLIGHT
I want you to monitor us here, and see that we're on time.

FAO
Roger.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, no AGS, right?

CONTROL
No AGS.

FLIGHT
No AGS.

CONTROL
We need the ATCA breaker, but no AGS.

FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT.

FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Now run one for 61:45.

FDO
Copy.

CONTROL
It's for the gimbals, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Negative.

FLIGHT
ATCA AGS? Is that what he said?

CONTROL
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
He's only reading out the ones he's leaving open, is that right?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. The ones that are black in the checklist, which he is deviating, he is calling out.

60:47:03
CONTROL
Yeah. Okay. I assume the other ones he didn't mention are closed, if they are blacked in.

FLIGHT
Yes. By the book.

TELMU
No. Close that one.

FLIGHT
You want that one closed?

TELMU
Yeah. It doesn't pull any current.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, want that closed, it doesn't take any current.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

60:48:02
FLIGHT
INCO?

INCO
Roger.

FLIGHT
INCO?

INCO
Which circuit breaker is he talking about?

FLIGHT
He said can we leave the steerable off, and operate off the OMNIs?

INCO
That's true. We want the heater circuit breaker left in, though.

FLIGHT
Okay. Are you listening to the loop?

INCO
Yes.

FLIGHT
Yeah, we want the heater circuit breaker in, but we'll stick with the OMNIs.

INCO
Right.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
Okay, we've got a - our LOAD's ready to go, here, FLIGHT. We want to load a vector and external ∆V.

FLIGHT
Okay. Have the loads been verified, yet? Is this the same vector that's being run on a hybrid?

60:49:00
GUIDO
Close to it, FLIGHT. Essentially the same thing.

FLIGHT
You're sure of that?

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
And when they run it and say it's okay, we can assume it is? Is that right?

GUIDO
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Alright. Is it the same vector we would have used for this DPS +2 - LI +2 hours, or is it a different one?

GUIDO
Well, it's FDO's present vector, FLIGHT. The only problem that we're worried about is the integration problem on board -

FLIGHT
Yeah. Mmhmm.

GUIDO
Okay -

FLIGHT
And the scaling, and all that business.

GUIDO
Yeah, but the vector doesn't really matter all that much what vector it is.

GUIDO
This is - this is essentially one. We need to load this, though. Even if we do a P47 -

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
- we need to load this vector.

TELMU
Negative.

FLIGHT
Say again, TELMU? Negative?

TELMU
Negative.

FLIGHT
Negative?

FLIGHT
And, CAPCOM, if we get P00 and DATA, we will put a state vector and target LOAD in for him.

60:50:18
FLIGHT
Yes.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, you should have it.

GUIDO
Okay, FLIGHT. We'll have to wait until they get the uplink configured. INCO's working on it.

FLIGHT
ORDEAL?

CONTROL
Negative. You don't need it.

FLIGHT
Negative.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
Before we burn here, we should deploy the landing gear so that we don't get any control problems.

FLIGHT
Does that come up somewhere in the procedure?

CONTROL
It comes up, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Say again?

CONTROL
It comes up -

TELMU
Yes, it does.

FLIGHT
I didn't hear his question, Jack.

CAPCOM
ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11, we want it OPEN or CLOSED?

60:51:02
TELMU
Open.

FLIGHT
TELMU?

TELMU
Open.

FLIGHT
Open.

CAPCOM
Okay. Are we happy with the circuit breaker configuration? Do we want them to press on?

FLIGHT
Circuit breaker panel. CONTROL, GO or NO GO?

CONTROL
CONTROL is okay.

FLIGHT
TELMU?

TELMU
GO.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
We're GO.

FLIGHT
INCO?

INCO
GO.

FLIGHT
GO, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
What about the landing gear?

FLIGHT
They'll come to that in the checklist, apparently.

CAPCOM
Okay.

60:52:39
FAO
FLIGHT, FAO. We concur with that.

FLIGHT
We concur.

FLIGHT
FAO concurs.

FLIGHT
INCO, do you have the OMNI for the burn attitude?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, we're in the middle of a LOAD right now.

FLIGHT
Oh. Okay. CAP - what do you mean? You don't want them to maneuver?

GUIDO
That's right. Let's hold it.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, could he hold his maneuver until we finish the LOAD, please?

60:53:14
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
MIT recommendation for the maneuver to attitude is to use the TTCA rather than the auto-maneuver. Hand controller.

FLIGHT
Okay. He's been doing that. We'll give it to him.

CONTROL
Okay.

60:55:33
GUIDO
FLIGHT, we're through with the LOAD. They can maneuver.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
And you want TTCAs, right? CONTROL? For the maneuver?

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You want TTCAs for the maneuver, right?

CONTROL
To the burn attitude. That's affirm.

CONTROL
That is affirm, FLIGHT.

60:56:24
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT. We're through with the LOADing. He can go ahead with his maneuver. We recommend he uses TTCA.

FLIGHT
We recommend that, and we're through with the LOAD.

FLIGHT
Okay. Everybody in the room, we're back on the checklist.

FLIGHT
Do we want to -

CAPCOM
Are you with us now, on the checklist?

FLIGHT
Do we want to do the self-test? GUIDANCE?

60:57:05
GUIDO
FLIGHT, we did check the E-MOD, his E-MEMORY was GO.

FLIGHT
Do you want to do the self-test?

FLIGHT
Page 6, Activation.

GUIDO
The 2-hour Activation.

FLIGHT
On the 2-hour Activation. Do you want to do the self-test?

FAO
FLIGHT, FAO, you'll get behind if you do it.

GUIDO
It's not - it's not required, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Negative.

CAPCOM
Okay, let's go. Let's get in and -

FLIGHT
Let's go. Let's listen to the loop, and answer their questions.

CAPCOM
Answer up on the checklist.

FLIGHT
Negative, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Page 7.

TELMU
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Mmhmm.

60:58:07
CAPCOM
Okay, everybody. We have - we're on page 9 now, right?

FLIGHT
Yup. We scratched the VH - VHF. How about this LGC CMC clock sync T-ephems there, GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
We've already taken care of that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, already done.

FAO
FLIGHT, FAO -

FLIGHT
Go.

FAO
- they can pick up at the landing gear deploy at the bottom of 10.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, let's walk through it one piece at a time.

FLIGHT
That's good, Spence, but I don't want to skip anything. Let's just let them go through it.

CAPCOM
We need that landing gear out?

FLIGHT
Yes. They want it out.

CAPCOM
And we don't want the steerable.

60:59:04
FLIGHT
CONTROL, you want that done, right?

CONTROL
Affirmative.

??
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Okay. Standby for landing gear.

FLIGHT
Okay, let's watch the power when the - landing gear, there, gentlemen.

TELMU
Okay, powers are fine.

TELMU
It looks like landing gear deployed from here, FLIGHT.

61:00:19
CONTROL
Scratch that.

CONTROL
CONTROL concurs.

CAPCOM
How about AGS?

CONTROL
Delete AGS activation and self-test.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
- ?? complete.

FLIGHT
That's correct.

FLIGHT
And a target, right, GUIDANCE?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You got the target loaded also, right?

GUIDO
Roger. He's got it.

GUIDO
He's got it, FLIGHT.

61:01:03
CAPCOM
How about you guys keeping ahead, here?

CAPCOM
How about AGS align, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
We don't need that. No AGS align.

CONTROL
Recommend we don't do that, FLIGHT. All we'd do is just close the DECA POWER breaker.

FLIGHT
Okay. You don't want to do the test.

CONTROL
Negative.

CAPCOM
You ready for DPS pressurization and checkout?

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

CONTROL
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Yes.

GUIDO
We need to configure the DAP.

FLIGHT
What - what do you need?

GUIDO
With what we read on the PAD.

61:02:02
FLIGHT
Okay, does he - he doesn't do that, here?

GUIDO
Step 2. Step 2.

FLIGHT
Wait a minute. Step 2. Okay, yeah. Okay, page 14.

CAPCOM
Okay.

FLIGHT
Page 14. Okay.

FLIGHT
How about 3, 4, 5, and 6, there? CONTROL? Although they -

CONTROL
We don't need it. That's - part of - that's what we're deleting.

FLIGHT
Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6?

CONTROL
Right.

FLIGHT
Wait. Wait a minute. We need to do step 2, right, GUIDANCE? Oh, okay. TTCA.

GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
That's caught later on, FLIGHT. The TTCA to MIN.

FLIGHT
Well - okay, but do we do it here? If we do it here, let's do it here.

CONTROL
Okay, fine.

FLIGHT
Yes, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
You want steps 2 and 3 on page 14.

FLIGHT
No. Nope. They were discussing the last thing on page 13.

CAPCOM
Oh, okay.

FLIGHT
TTCA both throttle to MIN.

CAPCOM
Okay.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

CAPCOM
Looks like they've got step 3, too.

61:03:01
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Okay - standby -

CONTROL
Affirmative, FLIGHT. He needs to trim the gimbal, not the throttle.

CONTROL
To trim the gimbal, FLIGHT, if you want to make it simple, just - you can do the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test steps 1, 2, and you've got it.

FLIGHT
Okay. Do you want to do all of step 1 now, is that what you're saying?

CONTROL
That just sets you up for step 2, that's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, correction. They want to do all of step 1 and step 2.

FLIGHT
Is that right, now, CONTROL?

CONTROL
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, we're going to do all of step 1 and step 2. Got it?

GUIDO
Roger.

CONTROL
Okay. One other comment, FLIGHT. Down in step 5, he de-arms the DPS, okay?

FLIGHT
Yes?

CONTROL
He has to do that particular item.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, we're just getting there, we're going through them one at a time, 1 and 2. Okay? Watch him do step 2, there, GUIDANCE. When he gets to it.

61:04:38
CONTROL
We can just go to PGNS MODE CONTROL to OFF.

FLIGHT
To OFF?

CONTROL
Yeah. It'll do the same thing.

CONTROL
He's in MIN IMPULSE now, he shouldn't be firing any jets. Except when he hits the ACA.

FLIGHT
Okay. Why can't he do it in AUTO? Why is this -

CONTROL
Okay. If he goes to AUTO, he goes to an ATTITUDE HOLD mode.

CONTROL
He'll fire jets to go to the attitude. Hold out the attitude he's in right now. Okay, that's no problem.

61:05:06
FLIGHT
What do you want us to do, CONTROL? What do you want us to do?

CAPCOM
You want an OMNI?

CONTROL
Standby 1.

FLIGHT
We're still hung up on step 1, near as I can tell.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, from CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Let's go to AUTO per the checklist.

FLIGHT
Per the checklist, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
Okay. You want them to pull his TCA breakers so that he doesn't get any red flags - jets firing, that is?

CONTROL
Well, what's the problem with jets firing?

CONTROL
I don't see any problem with it. He's in a 5 degree deadband.

61:06:03
FLIGHT
And the note expects it.

CONTROL
Yeah.

FLIGHT
And if he gets them it's okay.

CONTROL
Yeah. Just do it per the checklist.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
Do that and stop.

CONTROL
Go to AUTO and then stop, we'll take a look at it.

FLIGHT
Go to AUTO and then what?

CONTROL
And then stop. That's the question he asked. So he just wants to go to AUTO and then take a look at it.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
And then he gets the thruster firing, and then what?

CONTROL
Okay, you see it - watch it settle down, and then - and then we proceed on to test.

FLIGHT
Alright. That's what you want to do.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Got it, Jack?

FLIGHT
Will they stabilize with the docked configuration all right?

61:07:01
CONTROL
It should, FLIGHT. We've got the DAP set up, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Okay, let's watch it.

CONTROL
We've got no firings, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
Proceed on the test.

FLIGHT
We're ready to proceed.

CONTROL
Getting a little thruster activity.

FLIGHT
Y'all, GUIDANCE, down there, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go.

FLIGHT
You getting that GO, yet?

GUIDO
Negative. We haven't received it yet, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What's your estimate on it? We need it for the burn.

GUIDO
We're getting it right now, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Okay, you watch his loading?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Roger.

61:08:00
FLIGHT
GO.

CAPCOM
Okay, he's loading his gimbal now, let's watch him.

FLIGHT
Okay, watch the gimbal trim there.

CONTROL
Roger.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FDO
Closest approach will be 136.5.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
He needs to - on step 2, there, when he loads VERB 48 NOUN 46, the DAP load 32021, that was not correct on the DAP. He's got our old DAP mode in right now, he didn't put that in.

FLIGHT
What do you want us to do?

CONTROL
He should go per the checklist, 32021.

FLIGHT
What - okay, where is that?

61:09:00
CONTROL
Step 2, second line.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
Page 14.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you got that?

CONTROL
Per the book.

CONTROL
He can do that after he gets through the test, no problem.

FLIGHT
Well, okay, but it's there for some reason.

FLIGHT
FAO, how are we doing on time?

FAO
FLIGHT, we are sitting alright. The only other thing we've got left is the DPS press. And -

FLIGHT
And then we go into the 6 minute?

FAO
That's right.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
Keep - keep track of us, here. Spencer, about -

CAPCOM
Okay, you ready for the gimbal?

FAO
Okay.

CONTROL
Ready.

FLIGHT
Ready for the gimbal.

CONTROL
Right.

CONTROL
Got DPS arm.

CONTROL
And we're driving.

61:10:01
CAPCOM
Okay, and one other point that's brought out here, we've got a 4-jet ullage loaded in the DAP, and we've got 2 in the PAD.

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
That's right, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
What do you want us to do?

CONTROL
Standby on that.

CONTROL
Okay, to get - to make it agree with the PAD, the DAP load would be changed to be 31021.

FLIGHT
Well. Do you want to - why don't we just leave it the way it is?

CONTROL
As far as I'm concerned we can leave it the way it is.

FLIGHT
RETRO, FDO, you copy that?

RETRO
Say again, FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
You copy that? We're going to do a 4-jet. That's what we've got loaded. That alright with you?

RETRO
Roger.

FDO
Go with the way it is, then, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yeah. CAPCOM, mention that to him so he doesn't think of it later and get confused. We're going with the 4-jet, vice the 2-jet on the PAD.

CAPCOM
Okay. Are we seeing his gimbal go where it's supposed to?

CONTROL
Yes. It's over against the stop and coming back now.

61:11:00
FLIGHT
Still on our way.

CAPCOM
Okay.

CONTROL
We're GO on the trim.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Trim looks okay.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
Looks good.

61:12:03
CAPCOM
What numbers did we actually read up?

FLIGHT
How close were they?

CONTROL
We're within about 0.3. We're - from the -

CONTROL
Roger. We're ready.

FLIGHT
The what? Wait a minute, didn't you want the engine arm off?

CONTROL
It is off.

FLIGHT
Okay. Everything else is okay? Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6?

CONTROL
From what I can see, it is.

CAPCOM
Alright. You're ready for pressurization -

FLIGHT
You don't have any question about that, then, do you? CONTROL?

CONTROL
No. Looks fine.

FLIGHT
Alright. Yeah, we're ready.

FLIGHT
Are we coming up on another OMNI?

61:13:11
CONTROL
Pressurized, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Keep your eye on it, okay?

CONTROL
Looks good.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
Delete that, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Delete all of it?

CONTROL
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
Yeah. We delete it all, CAPCOM.

CAPCOM
How's the DPS look?

CONTROL
Looks fine.

61:14:06
FLIGHT
Okay, everybody. We are holding at about the 6 minute point in the checklist.

CAPCOM
Okay, at the bottom of page 15, we've got a new DAP. We've got 31021. You want that in there?

CONTROL
That's what put us in a 2-jet boot, FLIGHT. That will put us in 2-jet system boot for the ullage.

FLIGHT
Okay. But -

CONTROL
Just leave it alone.

FLIGHT
Yeah. We'll leave it where it is, Jack.

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
We told him 4 jets, that's what he's got.

CAPCOM
Roger.

FLIGHT
And we - we - has he passed page 15?

AFD (off loop)
Yeah. He's right here -

FLIGHT
He's on 16 now, right? Yeah, he's into it. GUIDANCE, FLIGHT -

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
- I'm waiting for that GO.

GUIDO
We watched his P30 here, it looks good.

FLIGHT
Yeah, I know. But have you got somebody talking to MIT?

GUIDO
They're still talking to them, haven't got an estimate yet.

FLIGHT
Well, we have 15 minutes to the burn.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go.

FLIGHT
How do I do this burn if I get a NO GO on - DAP control?

CONTROL
Okay, standby 1, I'll give you a rundown on that, FLIGHT, put my thoughts together.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
I'd recommend going ahead and doing this burn if we don't hear from MIT. They feel it'll work, without the run.

61:15:11
GUIDO
Everybody feels that it will work.

FLIGHT
Okay, well what do we do during it if it looks funny, is my question?

GUIDO
During the burn?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
PGN - okay, you want to do a PGNS AUTO or TTCA?

CONTROL
TTCA, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TTCA, CAPCOM. We recommend TTCA to the attitude.

FLIGHT
With a TTCA.

61:16:04
FLIGHT
INCO, what's our OMNI for this burn attitude?

INCO
FORWARD.

FLIGHT
Does he have it on there now?

INCO
He's there now.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
That attitude doesn't look like what I've got on the PAD, here.

CAPCOM
FLIGHT?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
You like that attitude?

FLIGHT
I'm looking at it. Standby.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT. You copying that?

GUIDO
What's on the ball right now?

FLIGHT
What angles are you looking at, CAPCOM? You looking at the ball angles?

CAPCOM
I'm looking at all of them. I'm looking at what he's got on the 50 18 on the DSKY, and also what he's got on the FCDUs -

GUIDO
FLIGHT, the pitch and roll look great. The yaw - the only reason it looks different is just because he's sitting there right now.

FLIGHT
Sitting where?

61:17:01
GUIDO
With the attitude he's at presently. The pitch and yaw - and roll are correct.

FLIGHT
Yeah. On the DSKY. Is that right?

GUIDO
Right.

FLIGHT
Yeah. The FDAI is different.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, we're looking at the FCDUs and they're correct.

FLIGHT
Mmhmm. How about yaw? That's the one that's out yet? And is he moving in that axis?

GUIDO
Yaw doesn't matter, FLIGHT, that's about the thrust vector. That's just where he happens to be.

CAPCOM
Okay, are we ready -

GUIDO
It's not constrained - it's not constrained in yaw.

CAPCOM
- for him to maneuver in the attitude we gave him in the -

FLIGHT
Yup.

FLIGHT
Do you want him to go to a particular yaw?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We okay on the OMNI? That we're on?

FLIGHT
INCO, we okay on this OMNI?

INCO
Yes. The OMNI they're on will be good.

FLIGHT
Okay. GUIDANCE and CONTROL, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
I still have a question as to what you want me to do if somehow or other something turns up in the guidance during this burn.

GUIDO
Okay, I have a recommendation, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
And it is?

GUIDO
Okay, with tur - setting up the burn, we would turn the ENGINE GIMBAL switch to OFF, we'd go to PGNS ATT HOLD, MIN IMPULSE on the - on the -

61:18:09
FLIGHT
Wait a minute. ENGINE GIMBAL - this - wait a minute. We're in the burn, and this is what you -

GUIDO
Oh. This is during the burn you're talking about?

FLIGHT
Well -

GUIDO
Okay.

FLIGHT
That's when this started. What do you want me to do for -

GUIDO
Okay. If he's in the burn, they'd go ENGINE GIMBAL off and just use the TTCA to hold attitude. And then as he can, to turn the MODE CONTROL switch to ATT HOLD.

FLIGHT
MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD.

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
In that order?

GUIDO
Yeah. ENGINE GIMBAL off, MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, and utilize the TTCA.

FLIGHT
Okay. So you changed the order.

GUIDO
Well, this MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, he can do that - he should do that as soon as he can, but that - the most important thing is he get attitude control, and he has to do that with the TTCA. So it'll probably be a simultaneous thing.

61:19:06
FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. Now, you verify his attitude?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE? You verify his attitude is okay?

GUIDO
He's not at attitude yet, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Is he moving?

GUIDO
Roger. He is moving. When he gets there, he'll be in good shape.

FLIGHT
Is there any way we can check this now, is there a star out of his window or anything?

GUIDO
We're running this - right now, we're running to see if there is a star available at the attitude he's maneuvering to.

FLIGHT
Alright. Hurry up.

GUIDO
There wasn't at the other atti - previous one that we had.

FLIGHT
Alright.

GUIDO
But he's at a different - going to a different yaw, so we're checking it.

61:20:23
FAO
FLIGHT, FAO.

FLIGHT
Go.

FAO
If we don't get to attitude soon, we're going to be running behind here.

FLIGHT
Okay. How far away are we?

FAO
I'm in the same boat as -

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, what are the DP - IMU attitudes that are on the DSKY that we're looking for?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
The IMU?

FLIGHT
What attitude will you read on the DSKY when he's in-attitude?

FLIGHT
CDU.

GUIDO
15.7 is yaw. Pitch is 178.1, and roll is 4.47.

FLIGHT
How far away is he?

61:21:00
GUIDO
He's just about there. He's right there now, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
We got any physical reference he can use?

FLIGHT
Okay. Have you seen any star yet?

FLIGHT
Okay.

CAPCOM
Verify the attitude?

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, you like the attitude?

GUIDO
Looks good, FLIGHT. The attitude looks good.

FLIGHT
Sun is out the forward window. That pretty much obscures a star.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Have you got anything on confirming the attitude?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. The only star available is star 86, there.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, MIT will not have a run on this thing.

FLIGHT
Okay, now - but it is the judgement that it is okay to use?

GUIDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
It is. Alright.

GUIDO
It's the judgement of the software people it's GO - it's good.

61:22:00
GUIDO
That it'll be alright.

GUIDO (off loop)
That's right.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go.

CONTROL
Okay. Could we possibly look ahead here and get some of these done so it doesn't get too crowded right by the start of the burn? There's a couple of items that need to be taken care of.

FLIGHT
Like what?

CONTROL
Well, we need to get THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL; he's in AUTO right now. It's over right - in the 4 minute segment. And we need to get VERB 65 in.

FLIGHT
Okay, what's the matter with him going through the nominal checklist?

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
He's in attitude, we're at the 6-minute point -

CONTROL
Okay. Very good.

FLIGHT
- that's comfortable. I don't want to change anything, Hal.

CONTROL
Okay.

61:23:08
FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

CAPCOM
Go.

FLIGHT
Jack, your opinion: think it would be worth reviewing that if he sees any kind of rates or anything to go ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL ATT CONTROL - ATTITUDE HOLD, and TTCA? You think it's worth reviewing with him?

FLIGHT
To finish the burn?

CAPCOM
I don't think it would hurt it to talk it over with him.

FLIGHT
Okay.

GUIDO
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
Affirmative.

TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

FLIGHT
Go.

TELMU
For your information, our water rate's dropped down a little in our favor.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

61:24:02
CAPCOM
FLIGHT? CAPCOM.

FLIGHT (off loop)
Yeah, I just mentioned it to him.

FLIGHT
Who's calling?

CAPCOM
CAPCOM's calling -

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
- I noticed on page 17, MANUAL THROTTLE -

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
Standby 1, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Top of page 18.

CAPCOM
He's right.

CONTROL
Negative, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
No need for that, Jack.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, while he's going through that, you might flag him on page 17 -

FLIGHT
Yes?

CONTROL
- THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO should be THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
And you can delete PQGS turned on at the bottom.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, you got that? THROTTLE CONTROL in the middle of that stuff at 4 minutes -

61:25:00
GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
How much - how much you want ullage?

CONTROL
We can just let it go ahead and start ullage automatically now, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
We'll let it go automatically, Jack.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go.

GUIDO
He needs to go ahead and hit ENTER on his program and proceed on the P40.

FLIGHT
Okay. He needs to do an ENTER and proceed on, CAPCOM.

GUIDO
There's still time yet, FLIGHT. Just a minute.

GUIDO
Oh, he did it, FLIGHT. Standby.

FLIGHT
And propellant quantity down at the bottom, don't worry about it. It's not on.

CAPCOM
No big deal.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, would you read them up that takeover?

FLIGHT
If you have it, there. Here it is if you don't.

61:26:01
CONTROL
ENTER, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You ready to ENTER?

CONTROL
Right. Do an ENTER.

FLIGHT
ENTER.

CAPCOM
He said, "what is it?"

FLIGHT
What did he say?

CAPCOM
He said, "what is it?"

FLIGHT
What is it, GUIDANCE?

GUIDO
It's for AUTO THROTTLE, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
It's for AUTO THROTTLE. That doesn't say much to me, GUIDANCE, but -

FLIGHT
We burn MANUAL, you know, GUIDANCE.

GUIDO
He's gotta manual-throttle the thing, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Yes.

CONTROL
He needs to put his throttle to MIN, also, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Throttle to MIN.

CONTROL
Yes. He's at 29% now, roughly.

FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, he needs to put his -

CONTROL
Standby, disregard that.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
I can't tell; he hasn't armed the DPS yet, but he needs to confirm that he does have it at MIN.

FLIGHT
Okay.

61:27:12
FLIGHT
Won't that - CONTROL, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
ATTITUDE HOLD and TTCA, won't that fight itself?

CONTROL
Negative. He's in MIN IMPULSE, FLIGHT. He goes ATT HOLD, it turns the jets off.

FLIGHT
Alright.

CAPCOM
Okay. How are you set up for 2 minutes?

FLIGHT
What's that Tig counting down to, GUIDANCE, the ullage?

GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. Engine ignition.

FLIGHT
Okay. What is - why is our clock counting a different number up there?

GUIDO
Time delay, FLIGHT, from -

FLIGHT
That's an awful big one.

GUIDO
- you're reading his DSKY.

FLIGHT
Plus, he's ahead of us.

RETRO
FLIGHT, RETRO. I've got an ignition time of 1:47. 1:45.

61:28:00
FLIGHT
Is he loaded correctly?

FLIGHT
Say again? GUIDANCE or RETRO? Is he loaded correctly?

FLIGHT
That's the question.

?? (off loop)
The Tig is right.

GUIDO
Tig is right, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
On board. Thank you.

GUIDO
Wall clock is wrong, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

CAPCOM
Okay, how do you like his configuration at 1 +30?

FLIGHT
CONTROL, everything okay with you?

CONTROL
We haven't seen the VERB 65, but that's okay if he doesn't get it.

FLIGHT
You satisfied with the throttle, or is he not armed yet?

CONTROL
He's not armed yet, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, okay?

GUIDO
We're good, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
CONTROL. Okay?

CONTROL
We're okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
TELMU?

TELMU
We're GO, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
INCO, okay?

INCO
We're good, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
All good here at 1 minute.

61:29:13
CONTROL
Still on VERB 65, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you want to tell them?

CONTROL
Yes. Tell him we need ENGINE ARM. He's got it. We're at low throttle point.

FLIGHT
We need a VERB 65 ENTER.

CONTROL
- -

FLIGHT
Is that what you're telling me, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Disregard.

FLIGHT
Thank you.

CONTROL
We have ullage.

CONTROL
We have ignition, low throttle point.

CONTROL
40 percent.

CONTROL
Rates look good.

FLIGHT
Rates are holding good, huh?.

61:30:01
CONTROL
Looking okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
Still looking good.

CONTROL
Shutdown.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Okay, how about what's left over?

FLIGHT
Any requirement to trim?

GUIDO
- - trim, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Trim to what?

GUIDO
0.2.

FLIGHT
Well. Kind of hard to do that.

FLIGHT
That's good, isn't it?

GUIDO
That's good enough.

FLIGHT
Good, CAPCOM.

FLIGHT
Yes.

61:31:05
TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU. He should - MASTER ARM OFF.

CONTROL
And he can go back to MIN IMPULSE when he desires, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well now, he's got to go through a number of things, right?

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay, CONTROL. The next question is what control mode, if any, do you want to be in, here? Work with the back room. Do we want to try to set up some kind of PTC in AGS or are we just going to power down, let this thing drift?

CONTROL
Okay. Let me pull my thoughts together for a minute, Glynn.

FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay, but you have somebody work that -

CONTROL
Yes. Roger.

FLIGHT
- I want you to watch to configuration, here.

61:32:02
INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
You got a minute to talk?

FLIGHT
Just a minute.

INCO
Okay.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, from CONTROL.

FLIGHT
How are we doing? Are we getting configured MASTER ARM?

TELMU
No. We've still got the MASTER ARM ON.

FLIGHT
Yeah, you'd better have them take the MASTER ARM OFF. CONTROL, anything for configuration?

CONTROL
The only thing I might recommend, if he wants to - the VERB 76 but I'm happy with the way it is right now.

FLIGHT
Okay. We're going to turn the PGNS down here, pronto.

CONTROL
Yeah, we've got to get the AGS turned up, though - and I've got the procedure here to give -

FLIGHT
Well, now, do we? Have to get it turned up?

CONTROL
Standby.

FLIGHT
How about just drifting?

CONTROL
If that's -

FLIGHT
Well, that's what I'm asking you to check.

CONTROL
Yeah, okay. But let's not turn the PGNS off right quick-like. Let me check for you.

FLIGHT
That's what we're going through right now.

61:33:04
INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
If you're going to do something with powering down, you'd better do it quick, because I'm going to have to make you do a handover here, and it's probably going to cost you COMM for at least 5 minutes.

FLIGHT
How soon? Are you going to have to hand over?

INCO
Well, the handover's going to have to go on here in about - 12, 13 minutes.

FLIGHT
Okay.

INCO
And we want to turn off the receiver - transceiver for 5 minutes up here.

61:34:00
FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT.

FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do you have any requirement for the PGNS anymore?

FDO
Negative.

FLIGHT
I'm not turning it down now. Look - - - go ahead.

FDO
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
The current situation is - is that we're checking about the PTC. We had - do we have an AGS procedure for setting up a PTC in AGS, now? CONTROL? That people think might work?

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Do we now have a procedure that people think might work in AGS?

CONTROL
Negative. Do not.

FLIGHT
We don't have a procedure?

CONTROL
Not right now. In AGS, for PTC.

FLIGHT
Well. It all rapidly gets academic, then, huh?

CONTROL
That's right.

CONTROL
Standby 1, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Jim's checking to see what he wants to tell us about PTC -

CONTROL
We're getting input from SPAN, it looks like no issue here - there's no PTC required.

FLIGHT
Okay, well, we'll wait and see in a minute. If that's so, there's no need in powering the AGS up.

CONTROL
That's right.

FLIGHT
We're waiting for them.

61:35:02
FLIGHT
Okay, and if that's the case, then we'll go ahead down. The only reason I'm delaying powering the PGNS down is to be sure we don't need the AGS. It sounds like we don't know how to use it anyway, but I - give them 2 minutes and we ought to know for sure.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
As I understand it, we're doing another burn at roughly 79 hours?

FLIGHT
Say again?

CONTROL
Are we doing another burn at 79 hours?

FLIGHT
Plan on that. Yes. I don't know whether we are or not -

CONTROL
How are we going to get alignment?

FLIGHT
Plan on that.

FLIGHT
Can you turn off the thrusters -

CONTROL
Affirmative, then he can go MODE CONTROL OFF, whatever he desires.

CONTROL
Stand - standby on that, FLIGHT. Standby on that.

FLIGHT
He asked if he could turn off the thrusters.

CONTROL
Standby on that. One moment, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, from CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
The reason I ask: if we turn everything down now, and then do another burn at 79 hours, how are we going to get alignment?

FLIGHT
Yeah, I know. I know.

FLIGHT (off loop)
When is that?

FLIGHT
FAO, when is the shadow of the Moon that we might get a P51 and 2?

61:36:00
FAO
Okay, FLIGHT. Standby and we'll look at that.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT. How much does it cost me to keep the AGS up, as a coarse reference?

TELMU
That's going to cost -

FLIGHT
How many pounds of water? And how many amps?

FLIGHT
Say again? Ed?

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Some items that we can actually pull right now and save some power that they don't need is the ATCA breaker, and the DECA GIMBAL and the DECA breaker.

61:37:05
FLIGHT
Now wait a minute. We don't want to be out of attitude control, do we?

CONTROL
That won't - I won't put you out of attitude control.

FLIGHT
Okay. That's right. That's the -

CONTROL
If you - if you want to save some power right now. We may have to put them back in later when we go to AGS, but -

FLIGHT
Okay, which ones were they?

CONTROL
The ATCA on CB 16, and the DECA GIMBAL and DECA POWER.

FLIGHT
Yeah. We can sure turn those off.

CONTROL
Roger. I suggest we do that.

FLIGHT
Let's start with the DECA ones, huh?

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, while we're going through this subject, two items for power conversation would be the DECA GIMBAL and POWER circuit breakers on panel - 16? 11.

CONTROL
11 for the DECA GIMBAL and DECA POWER. ATCA is on panel 16.

FLIGHT
What control now do I have if I turn off the ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker?

61:38:02
CONTROL
Not ATCA (PGNS). Just ATCA.

FLIGHT
Oh, okay. The ATCA on panel 16, huh?

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
Okay. There are a couple of power items.

CAPCOM (off loop)
Yes.

FLIGHT
While we're figuring out what to do.

CONTROL
Right.

??
Y'all, one thing you can do -

CONTROL
Okay. We confirm they're open, FLIGHT.

61:39:00
FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE -

GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Can you give us star - ball angles, I should say, for a COAS star check in the shadow?

GUIDO
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Pronto.

GUIDO
In the Moon shadow?

FLIGHT
No. No, in the shadow of the vehicles. Looking away from the Sun.

FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, can you get one of those in a hurry? That would give us a check on the reference before we do something with it.

61:40:00
CAPCOM
How about - how about the idea he just gave us about using the Command Module optics in manual? To find stars?

FLIGHT
Well, we can do that now - what's our objective here, to check the platform again?

FLIGHT
I mean, we can do a lot of things. I want to know why we want to do something.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
Okay, look, I'm running out of time.

FLIGHT
Yeah. I know.

INCO
Well, we've got to do a handover here. We don't have any choice. To try to make it as quick as possible, I want to turn down the transceiver for 5 minutes, let us push the IU out of the way, and then bring up the carrier after 5 minutes, when it comes on we'll be able to distinguish the LM. That's the quickest way we know how to try to do it. And we hope it works better than last time.

61:41:07
FLIGHT
Okay. Well you gotta hand over now, do you?

INCO
We don't have any choice. It's going to be one way or another - it's either going to be the hard way or the easy way. I can't guarantee either way.

FLIGHT
Okay. I wish I knew what we wanted to do, here, before we lost COMM.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
I've got a recommendation.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FLIGHT
EECOM? We gave him a GO on that, didn't we? He probably didn't hear it. Hook up the side hatch urine dump.

EECOM
Has he got - has he got it hooked up now?

FLIGHT
We don't know. He was -

EECOM
If he hadn't -

FLIGHT
Oh, you don't want to?

FLIGHT
What do you want him to use?

61:42:01
EECOM
Use the normal procedure. Let - - let me explain that.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. I've got a degree left. That's it.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we're going to have a loss of COMM here while we switch stations. Let them know that, will you?

INCO
FLIGHT, that's not what I want to do. I want him to turn the transceiver OFF for 5 minutes.

FLIGHT
Okay.

FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have him turn off the S-BAND transmitter/receiver.

INCO
5 minutes.

FLIGHT
5 minutes.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Can you wait, CONTROL?

CONTROL
Roger.

FLIGHT
He has to turn off the S-BAND transmitter for 5 minutes while we do a site handover with this COMM situation.

INCO
Transceiver.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FDO
Okay, confirmed burn shows -

61:43:01
FLIGHT
- - FDO, stand by a minute.

FDO
Roger.

FLIGHT
Unless you've got a problem.

FDO
No problem.

INCO
That's affirmative.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Affirmative.

CONTROL
That's good enough. That's real good.

CAPCOM
You ready for the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER?

FLIGHT
You ready for that? They're ready.

INCO
GO.

CAPCOM
On - turn it off now?

INCO
Roger.

FLIGHT
Go ahead, for 5 minutes.

61:44:07
INCO
He doesn't have to touch the POWER AMPL. Just the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, and he'd better hurry.

FLIGHT
They want to get some kind of roll attitude going if possible. CONTROL, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Can you figure out if we point the thing north, can you give us a mode in the AGS that we can set up a low roll rate?

CONTROL
Yeah, we can come up with one, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Could I have - could I ask for a little quiet in the room, please? It's getting awful noisy in here.

61:45:05
CONTROL
We can work on that, but I've got something in my mind here, that I think we ought to do first.

FLIGHT
Okay. And that is?

CONTROL
And that is to bring the PGNS - bring the AGS up, take the PGNS alignment to it, turn that PGNS off.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CONTROL
We're eating power.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CONTROL
We can do that now.

FLIGHT
Okay. As soon as we get the COMM.

CONTROL
And I've got the procedure for doing it.

FLIGHT
Bring it over, please.

61:48:29
FLIGHT
FAO, FLIGHT.

FAO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
When are we going to have the timing that we're in the Moon shadow?

FAO
I'm trying to find out from FDO now, when he's going back to reference with it, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay. Pronto, okay? As soon as you can?

FAO
Roger.

FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

FDO
Would you like some post-burn data?

FLIGHT
Yes.

FDO
Okay. Closest approach 136.75.

FLIGHT
That's based on the confirmed maneuver?

FDO
That's affirm.

FLIGHT
From the PGNS.

FDO
That's affirm.

61:49:00
FDO
We've got a gamut entry interface of -6.53.

FLIGHT
Okay. I'm - with - that's all coming out nominal, then.

FDO
Roger. What's even better is that the doppler is within 7 cycles.

FLIGHT
So you think the doppler confirms it.

FDO
The doppler says that we're - we did the right things, that's affirm.

FLIGHT
Alright.

FLIGHT
FDO and FAO, when are you going to have the time for me when we're behind the Moon?

61:50:58
INCO
Hold on a second now, Jack.

61:51:00
FLIGHT
- - you're on the loop, Ed.

FLIGHT
What's the conclusion? We can keep the IMU up?

FLIGHT
And we've got the water?

?? (off loop)
Well, we may have to turn off some other things.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Are you guys coming together with what's being discussed up here for a recommendation - I'm being told that we could conceivably leave the IMU up in the LM - turn the LGC, I guess, OFF right now, leave the IMU up, and power down post-PC+2 DPS burn.

61:52:12
FLIGHT
Are you involved in all that?

TELMU
Yeah. I have to leave the total load, there, of course. We've been kind of involved with the EPS concern.

FLIGHT
Bill Peters has been in - Bill, would you, quick, tag in now -

Gold TELMU
Okay.

FLIGHT
- I'd like, quickly, to know what you want done.

INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

INCO
Have at it.

61:53:51
FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT - gentlemen, it's getting noisy in the room.

TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Let's keep down the conversations.

61:54:09
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Okay. Go ahead. Calling, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
One - CONTROL. One thing to consider, Glynn, is if we do this, we're going to have to have - implement a method of keeping them out of gimbal lock.

FLIGHT
I guess they're just going to have to watch it.

CONTROL
He's got nothing to watch on board. We're powering everything down.

FLIGHT
No, we're going to leave the IMU up.

CONTROL
Okay. Got to leave the inverters up, then.

FLIGHT
Okay, well that's what I'm waiting for TELMU to tell me.

CAPCOM
We need a DAP load to conserve RCS.

FLIGHT
A DAP load to conserve RCS, CONTROL.

CONTROL
Okay. He wants it right now?

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Right now.

61:55:02
CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

CONTROL
Recommend he goes VERB 76 MIN IMPULSE, and then keep his eye on the middle gimbal angle.

FLIGHT
Okay. Is that all you've got to tell them for the DAP?

CONTROL
Yeah, the DAP load's okay. But he needs to go MIN IMPULSE.

FLIGHT
Okay.

CONTROL
VERB 76. And keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle.

FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
I guess I kind of need to know, here, as much as you do -

TELMU
Roger.

FLIGHT
- if we're okay to leave the IMU up and we can swing it. Then I'd just as soon do that.

TELMU
Yeah. I think that's the way it's looking right now.

FLIGHT
Okay, how long will it take you to conclude that?

TELMU
Just a couple more minutes.

CAPCOM
Do we have a PAD for 79 hours?

61:56:01
FLIGHT
Not yet, I'm sure.

FLIGHT
Okay, gentlemen. The proposal before the room right now is to turn down the LGC and to pick up all the rest of the smaller power items we can. Leave the IMU up; TELMU's within a few minutes of -

TELMU
Yeah.

FLIGHT
- coming in on that subject.

TELMU
We can - we can do that, FLIGHT, with the IMU up and the AC. It looks like it would probably -

FLIGHT
The AC. You mean one ball. Okay. Is that what you mean?

TELMU
Yeah. Inverters. Yeah. Looks like also it would probably be cheaper, power-wise, to turn the steerable on, if we could get COMMs attention here - INCO.

FLIGHT
INCO, you up?

INCO
Yes.

TELMU
Turn the steerable up, since we've got the AC anyway, and power down the POWER AMPL.

FLIGHT
Is that cheaper?

TELMU
It's cheaper power-wise.

61:57:00
FLIGHT
INCO, is that okay with you?

INCO
We'll give it a try.

FLIGHT
That gives us kind of - spotty coverage, doesn't it?

INCO
We're going to have to get into a different attitude.

FLIGHT
We're going to have to roll.

INCO
That's right. We're going to have to get out of the attitude we're in.

FLIGHT
Can you do it on the high-gain, or - you can't switch OMNIs anyway.

FLIGHT
Well, we've got a guy awake.

INCO
He'll have to do it for us.

FLIGHT
We've got a guy awake anyway.

FLIGHT
Well -

FLIGHT
Will we get high-gain coverage, and then we'll drop off, is that what'll happen?

INCO
Yeah, it'll go at the end of blockage or gimbal limits and he'll have to switch to an OMNI.

FLIGHT
Recommend something to me, will you? How many amps do we save?

TELMU
FLIGHT, we just save about an amp and a half, so it's not a -

FLIGHT
And it's not a - it's not a coolant item. It's not a water item, is it?

TELMU
Yeah.

FLIGHT
Alright, I'm - let's let that go for tonight anyway. Maybe we'll figure something clever out tomorrow night.

TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
Okay, TELMU. Have you concluded on this LGC?

TELMU
We're going to leave the IMU up, right?

FLIGHT
Yeah, but the computer you want to go down? If we want that, let's get on with it.

FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

61:58:00
CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You ready? You and TELMU, are you together there -

CONTROL
Yeah, I'm trying to get - get my ducks in a row with him right now, FLIGHT. Standby.

GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

FLIGHT
Go ahead.

GUIDO
You asked a while ago about some stars. I've got some - I picked out some stars to look - if you - I don't know if he wants to do any maneuvering - the maneuver, it's 180 degrees from the Sun. To center the COAS.

FLIGHT
Okay. Well, standby with it.

CONTROL
FLIGHT, from CONTROL.

FLIGHT
Yeah.

CONTROL
Did we just tell him to power the computer down?

FLIGHT
No, we're just advising on what the plan's going to be.

CONTROL
Oh, okay.

FLIGHT
But we're waiting.

CONTROL
Yeah, okay.

61:59:56
FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, have you got there yet?

TELMU
Roger, FLIGHT.

62:00:00
CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT.

FLIGHT
You're GO to power the LGC down?

CONTROL
Right.

TELMU
Yeah. LGC and IMU.

FLIGHT
What do you want to do? Pull the circuit breakers?

TELMU
Standby.

FLIGHT
Did you give me something on it?

TELMU
I think Bob Carlton did, didn't you, Bob?

CONTROL
You said power down or power up?

FLIGHT
Down.

CONTROL
Oh.

FLIGHT
CONTROL?

CONTROL
Yeah.

FLIGHT
I'm talking - we're going to leave the IMU up, then. Are you ready to proceed and power the computer down?

CONTROL
Negative! I do not want to power the computer down.

FLIGHT
Now why not?

CONTROL
I'm being told that we can leave it up for the sleep period and it will keep their attitude for them, keep them out of gimbal lock.

FLIGHT
The computer also?

CONTROL
Yes. That's what I've been told. The LGC.

FLIGHT
Okay. So you'd tell them to leave the computer up also, huh?

CONTROL
Affirmative.

FLIGHT
And that's okay on the profile?

TELMU
That's affirmative.

TELMU
It's about 22 amps total.

FLIGHT
And what kind of control mode do you see them being in, here tonight?

CONTROL
Okay, just in a 5 degree deadband ATTITUDE HOLD.

FLIGHT
Wait a minute. We don't want to be in ATTITUDE HOLD. We want to roll - oh, you want to let roll go?

62:01:03
CONTROL
You can't let roll go. It's going to be an ATT HOLD.

FLIGHT
Okay, but - Hal, can we fly ATT HOLD the whole time? We're going to burn something up!

CONTROL
I've got the question in, I haven't got an answer on it yet, FLIGHT.

CONTROL
The tentative answer I got was we did not require any PTC.

CONTROL
Yeah, the only problem, Glynn, if - in the other mode, if we just leave the platform up, we may drift through gimbal lock and that would defeat the purpose of leaving it up.

FLIGHT
We have a guy sitting there watching it! We're going to keep a guy up!

CONTROL
Okay. And we're going to have to leave the inverters on also, then.

FLIGHT
Yeah!

CONTROL
Okay.

FLIGHT
That's - that was what I thought you were talking about!

CONTROL
Negative. I was out of step with you, FLIGHT. Sorry.

FLIGHT
And we'll set up a roll manually, and we'll let them watch it and we'll do the best we can like we did for Apollo 8.

CONTROL
Okay. If he does it that way, he'll have to use hard-over command on the ACA to stop any perturbations, then.

CONTROL
ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL breaker has to be in. Yes, use hard over on the ACA.
