[55 46 46 - 55 46 50] CAPCOM
Okay FLIGHT, you read his pitch and yaw and his high-gain meter.

[55 46 50 - 55 46 51] FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

[55 46 51 - 55 46 55] CAPCOM
And now you want roll right to 060?

[55 46 56 - 55 47 08] FLIGHT
Might as well do that. And we'll try and get Comet Bennett, I'd still like the verification on the docking angle because that's what we'll be using for computation for alignments and everything else. Let's see if there's anything else.

[55 47 08] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 47 09] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[55 47 10 - 55 47 13] EECOM
Okay, let's terminate battery B charge at 55 plus 50.

[55 47 14] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 47 15 - 55 47 20] EECOM
And at the same time, I'd sure like to have a cryo stir, all four tanks.

[55 47 20 - 55 47 22] FLIGHT
Let's wait until they get settled down a little more.

[55 47 22] EECOM
Roger.

[55 47 23] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 47 24] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[55 47 25 - 55 47 28] GNC
I would still like to enable the other two quads for the maneuver.

[55 47 29 - 55 47 35] FLIGHT
Okay. When rolling to 060 you want them to enable C and D, right?

[55 47 35] GNC
Right.

[55 47 36 - 55 47 38] FLIGHT
Do you want them to disable A and B?

[55 47 38] GNC
No.

[55 47 38 - 55 47 40] FLIGHT
Okay. All four quads.

[55 47 40 - 55 47 41] GNC
They have a couple of jet maneuvers -

[55 47 42 - 55 47 44] FLIGHT
Roger. Copy, CAPCOM?

[55 47 44] CAPCOM
Got it.

[55 47 46] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[55 47 47] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[55 47 47 - 55 47 49] INCO
I'd like to confirm their configuration on their high-gain now.

[55 47 50] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 47 51 - 55 47 56] INCO
I'd like to know what track mode they're in and what SERVO electronics they're in.

[55 47 56 - 55 48 04] FLIGHT
Okay, let's just standby 1 there. Now we'll C and D for roll to 060, terminate battery B charge.

[55 48 10 - 55 48 25] FLIGHT
Okay, the third thing we want up there, CAPCOM is to verify their high-gain configuration. And I assume what you want from there is you want to know their tracking, position of track - beam width you don't need, do you? Do you want the whole works?

[55 48 25] INCO
Yeah, the whole works.

[55 48 25] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 48 31 - 55 48 35] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we want the configuration of the CSM high-gain.

[55 49 34] INCO
That's good.

[55 49 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 05] FLIGHT
Good report.

[55 50 09] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 50 10] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[55 50 11 - 55 50 14] GNC
Can we verify that they reenabled C-4 thruster?

[55 50 20 - 55 50 23] FLIGHT
Okay. Verify that they re- - you're showing that disabled, yes?

[55 50 23] GNC
Yes.

[55 50 24 - 55 50 27] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, restore CM C-4 thruster; disabled.

[55 50 33] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 50 34] FLIGHT
Go EECOM.

[55 50 34 - 55 50 36] EECOM
You've got 40 amp-hours back in battery B now.

[55 50 37] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 42] EECOM
You got it, FLIGHT.
> Possibly in response to seeing BAT B charge disabled.

[55 50 43] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 54 -] FLIGHT
Okay, all flight controllers. I want to go around the horn and pick up anything you need configuration-wise. TELMU -

[55 51 01] TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[- 55 51 04] FLIGHT
- you still worried about any configuration items?

[55 51 06 - 55 51 14] TELMU
Negative. The LM heater current indicates that the LM was properly closed out. They apparently have not closed the LM hatch yet.

[55 51 14 - 55 51 21] FLIGHT
Okay. So you're happy that you don't need them to verify that - what was it, activation 2-3, those pages we were on?

[55 51 21 - 55 51 23] TELMU
That's right. That was TLC 2, and we're happy.

[55 51 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 51 27] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 51 29] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 51 30 - 55 51 32] GUIDO
Can we ask about the docking index again?

[55 51 33 - 55 51 35] FLIGHT
CAPCOM will get that for me.

[55 51 55 - 55 51 57] FLIGHT
Okay. Got your answer, GUIDANCE?

[55 51 57] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[55 51 58 - 55 52 00] FLIGHT
Okay, go with it.

[55 52 31 - 55 52 34] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you got any configuration items here?

[55 52 35] GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

[55 52 37 - 55 52 43] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, looks like the last item we need here is a stir on H2 and O2 at their convenience.
> The fateful but inevitable request.

[55 52 44] CAPCOM
Okay.

[55 53 55] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 53 59] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 00 - 55 54 07] GUIDO
We finally got a ∆H update. Do you want to just read it up to the crew or just uplink it?

[55 54 08 - 55 54 13] FLIGHT
Let's see. Can we collapse deadbands and do all that good stuff if we uplink here?

[55 54 18 - 55 54 22] GUIDO
Uh. Yeah. Why don't we just read it up to them?

[55 54 23 - 55 54 25] FLIGHT
If they enter it through the DSKY are they gonna do it?

[55 54 26] GUIDO
Standby 1.

[55 54 30 - 55 54 34] FLIGHT
Now, we haven't stabled out at that attitude yet, so I don't think we're gonna have any problems.

[55 54 34 - 55 54 36] GNC
FLIGHT, I don't think there's any problem, they haven't opened up deadbands yet.

[55 54 37 - 55 54 41] FLIGHT
Yeah, that's just what I'm saying. The time to do it is now, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 41] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 42] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 43 - 55 54 54] GUIDO
As long as he's in P00 and don't reselect it, he can uplink it - enter it himself or we can do it easier. Doesn't matter.

[55 54 57 -] FLIGHT
Okay. Why don't - you gotta pass the data for the crew checklist anyway on-board, don't you?

[55 55 04] GUIDO
Right.

[- 55 55 08] FLIGHT
Don't you have page update? Well, why don't we read it up to them and that'll serve both purposes.

[55 55 10] GUIDO
Alright.

[55 55 10 - 55 55 14] FLIGHT
Both have them enter it as well as why don't you tell them what page you want it in the checklist?

[55 55 15] GUIDO
Okay.

[55 55 18] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[55 55 18] FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

[55 55 19 - 55 55 23] TELMU
We show the LM overhead hatch is closed, and the heater current looks normal.

[55 55 23] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 55 26] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 55 27] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 55 27 - 55 55 29] GUIDO
We've had a hardware restart. I don't know what it was.

[55 55 29 - 55 55 35] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you want to look at it? See if you see any problems?

[55 55 37 - 55 55 39] FLIGHT
Roger. We're copying it, CAPCOM. We see a hardware restart.

[55 55 41 - 55 55 44] FLIGHT
You see an AC BUS UNDERVOLT there, GUIDANCE? Err - EECOM?

[55 55 46] EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

[55 55 48 - 55 55 49] FLIGHT
I believe the crew reported it.

[55 55 50 - 55 55 51] CAPCOM
We've got a MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

[55 55 51 - 55 55 54] EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got some instrumentation funnies, let me add them up.
> Having missed the pre-explosion pressure spike on tank 2, all EECOM has to work with now is a Christmas tree of bad data readout. So many numbers were off whack all of a sudden that EECOM assumes it has to be instrumentation. Lengthy discussion ensues on the EECOM loop (available audio track).
> Poor Sy had a "two-handed deathgrip" on his console by now.[ref2 p210]

[55 55 54] FLIGHT
Roger.

[55 56 00 - 55 56 02] EECOM
We may have had an instrumentation problem, FLIGHT.

[55 56 03] FLIGHT
Roger.

[55 56 07] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[55 56 08] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[55 56 09 - 55 56 11] INCO
We switched to WIDE BEAM about the time we had the problem.
> A red herring, but a believable one if the problem were instrumentation or telemetry.

[55 56 33] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 56 42 - 55 56 44] FLIGHT
INCO, you say you went to wide beam with that?

[55 56 44] INCO
Yes.

[55 56 48 - 55 56 53] FLIGHT
Let's see if we can correlate those times. Get the time when you went wide beam, INCO.

[55 56 55] INCO
Okay.

[55 57 02 - 55 57 03] CAPCOM
Do we have the floodlights off right now?

[55 57 04] TELMU
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[55 57 05 - 55 57 08] FLIGHT
Yeah, we can determine that from the LM current.

[55 57 37] FLIGHT
Roger, we copy that also.

[55 58 13 -] FLIGHT
EECOM, you see any AC problems? Looks like -

[55 58 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[- 55 58 17] FLIGHT
we have a lot of instrumentation problems here. Go ahead.

[55 58 18 - 55 58 22] EECOM
That's affirm. {He's flipping the fuel cells around, FLIGHT.}
1> This ended up being a problem for the flight controllers. The astronauts were doing their own problem solving and configuration changes, so every time the controllers on the ground had a recommendation for them something would get changed and they'd have to start over.[ref2 p212]

[55 58 23 - 55 58 26] FLIGHT
Well, let's get some recommendation here, Sy, if you've got any better ideas.

[55 58 32 - 55 58 34] FLIGHT
Sy, what do you want to do? Hold your own, and -

[55 58 40 - 55 58 43] FLIGHT
- Sy, have you got a SIG SENSOR type problem there, or what?

[55 58 43] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 58 44] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[55 58 45 - 55 59 01] EECOM
He's got fuel cells 1 and 3 are offline. We've got MAIN A volts, we have no MAIN B volts. Have them attempt to reconnect the fuel cells. FUEL CELL 1 to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.

[55 59 02 -] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 59 03 -] EECOM
We just gotta -

[ - ] FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 1 -

[- 55 59 07] EECOM
- back to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 back to MAIN B.

[- 55 59 10] FLIGHT
- MAIN A, 3 to MAIN B.

[55 59 10] EECOM
Let's see what happens.

[55 59 11 - 55 59 14] FLIGHT
Okay, now is there - do we have instrumentation problems?

[55 59 16 -] EECOM
Well, we've lost - it does appear we've lost AC BUS 2 VOLTAGE. MAIN B is reading - 4 VOLTS. And that effectively takes AC 2 away from us -
> AC BUS 2 could only draw power from DC MAIN B BUS.

[55 59 29] FLIGHT
Okay.

[ - ] EECOM
- the - yeah and he reported barber poles on the -

[55 59 35] FLIGHT
Roger.

[- 55 59 36] EECOM
- on the fuel cell on-board, too, FLIGHT.

[55 59 36] FLIGHT
(unintelligible) yeah.

[55 59 38] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 59 39] EECOM
Let's see if we can get our DC back.

[55 59 40] FLIGHT
Roger. Go ahead, GNC.

[55 59 41 - 55 59 43] GNC
Verify that the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVES are open.

[55 59 46 - 55 59 51] FLIGHT
You seeing an attitude problem or you seeing some BI-levels that are giving you problems?

[55 59 51 - 55 59 59] GNC
No, it's some low pressures in the fuel and oxidizer which would be symptomatic of the {HELIUM VALVE closing and firing some jets.}
1> Here he means these two things both happening, not that the valve closing would cause jet firing. Helium is used as an inert gas to maintain pressure in many propellant tanks even today. If the helium isn't coming in, propellant gas exits the tank without anything re-entering to keep the pressure up.
> Kranz notes[ref1 p312] that this was a moment of realization for him; the reported bang must have been pretty strong to have jarred shut the valve. He'd seen something similar on Apollo 9 during CSM/S-IVB separation.

[55 59 59 - 56 00 01] FLIGHT
Quad number 2 HELIUM VALVE open?

[56 00 01] GNC
Quad Delta.

[56 00 02 - 56 00 05] FLIGHT
Quad Delta - HELIUM VALVE open, right?

[56 00 05] GNC
Right.

[56 00 10 - 56 00 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to verify quad Delta HELIUM VALVE is open, please.

[56 00 16 - 56 00 18] FLIGHT
Are there other problems in the RCS?

[56 00 20 - 56 00 24] CAPCOM
Okay, is that all we've come up with for them; have we got any other recommendations?
> CAPCOM is anxious.

[56 00 25 - 56 00 33] FLIGHT
Yeah, we wanted to get FUEL CELL 1 configured to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B. Did you pass that up?

[56 00 32] EECOM
Let's attempt that, FLIGHT.

[56 00 37 - 56 00 42] FLIGHT
INCO, this seems to be an AC type problem, it may be tied into that high-gain thing you got.

[56 00 45 - 56 00 49] INCO
We went to WIDE BEAM with - FLIGHT - at 55:55:04, best we can tell.

[56 00 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 01 06] EECOM
I copy, FLIGHT.

[56 01 09 - 56 01 13] EECOM
Let me commiserate on that.

[56 01 16 - 56 01 20] CAPCOM
Is there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation or have we got a real problem, or what?
> The lack of answer here is telling. At some point here, steely-eyed missile man and NASA legend EECOM John Aaron had gotten called at home. He asked for some numbers to be read out, and while bolting out the door warned them that whatever it was, it _wasn't_ instrumentation.[ref2 p213]

[56 01 34] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 01 35] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 01 36 - 56 01 38] EECOM
Let's reverse the configuration request -

[56 01 38 - 56 01 44] FLIGHT
Okay, now wait a minute. We've got a good MAIN A BUS, let's make sure that whatever we do doesn't screw up MAIN A. MAIN A -

[56 01 43 -] EECOM
FUEL CELL 2 is on MAIN A, FLIGHT -

[56 01 45] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 01 47] EECOM
- and I'm not going to ask to change that.

[56 01 47] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do?

[56 01 48 - 56 01 55] EECOM
Let's try to put FUEL CELL 1 on MAIN B, FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A. We'll use the other sensing circuitry.

[56 01 57 - 56 02 00] FLIGHT
FUEL CELL number 1 on MAIN B -

[56 02 00] EECOM
- FUEL CELL 3 on main A.

[56 02 09 - 56 02 11] EECOM
We're not going to touch FUEL CELL 2, FLIGHT.

[56 02 12 - 56 02 22] FLIGHT
Okay, but if we got any problems in the system I want to make sure that we don't blow the voltage off MAIN A, then we're not going to be able to see anything.

[56 02 28 - 56 02 35] FLIGHT
Can we review our status here, Sy, and see what we've got from a standpoint of status. What do you think we've got in the spacecraft that's good?

[56 02 35 - 56 02 37] EECOM
MAIN BUS A is reading 25 volts.

[56 02 38] FLIGHT
Okay. MAIN A -

[56 02 39 - 56 02 48] EECOM
And that's reflected by the fact - FUEL CELL 2 is putting out 53 amps, which is just about the most it can and keep our voltage up.

[56 02 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 02 48 - 56 02 54] EECOM
So that's bona fide. AC BUS 2 is zero, which is reflected by the fact that we lost MAIN B.

[56 02 55 - 56 02 57] FLIGHT
AC BUS -

[56 02 59] EECOM
Standby, FLIGHT.

[56 03 03] FLIGHT
- zero output.

[56 03 07] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 03 13] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 03 14 - 56 03 25] EECOM
Okay. If we want to keep - - standby, he's changing configuration, we've got BATTERY A on MAIN A.

[56 03 27] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 03 27 - 56 03 29] EECOM
Sorry - I was going to ask you for the battery on, FLIGHT.

[56 03 30] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[56 03 31] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[56 03 31 - 56 03 36] INCO
We need OMNI Bravo. Our high-gain won't drive without AC 2.

[56 03 37 - 56 03 39] FLIGHT
Okay. You want OMNI Bravo?

[56 03 39] INCO
Right.

[56 03 48 - 56 03 53] FLIGHT
You don't think we're going to be able to get high-bitrate data here, do you? On the OMNIs.

[56 03 53] INCO
Well, maybe. We've got the 210s.

[56 03 54 -] FLIGHT
You've got the 210s -

[56 03 56] INCO
Correct.

[ - ] FLIGHT
Okay, that'll save a bit of power. CAPCOM, recommend selection of OMNI Bravo, please -

[56 04 01] INCO
It's Charlie now.

[- 56 04 03] FLIGHT
Okay, Charlie.

[56 04 03] INCO
He's maneuvering.

[56 04 05] CAPCOM
OMNI Charlie?

[56 04 06] FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

[56 04 06] INCO
Roger.

[56 04 27 - 56 04 30] INCO
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got OMNI Charlie and high-bitrate.

[56 04 31 -] FLIGHT
Okay. You have high-bitrate now off the 210s, right? OMNI -

[56 04 34] INCO
Right.

[- 56 04 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 04 58] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 04 59] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 05 00 -] EECOM
Okay. Let's get readout on a couple of fuel cell pressures here -

[56 05 04] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 05 17] EECOM
- FUEL CELL 1 N2 pressure. FUEL CELL 3 O2 pressure. We're reading zero {N2 pressure} on FUEL CELL 1 and 13psi on FUEL CELL 3 O2 pressure.
1> Nitrogen was used to pressurize the electrolytes in the fuel cell through a diaphragm, as well as the reactant feed systems. Feedback loops are set up with the cryogenic oxygen to regulate the relative pressures.

[56 05 19 -] FLIGHT
Okay, you want FUEL CELL 1 -

[56 05 21] EECOM
N2 pressure.

[- 56 05 25] FLIGHT
- N2 pressure. FUEL CELL 3, what do you want there?

[56 05 26] EECOM
O2 pressure.

[56 05 26 - 56 05 30] FLIGHT
O2 pressure. CAPCOM, let's get those as a start.

[56 05 33] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[56 05 34] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[56 05 35 - 56 05 45] GUIDO
When his hardware restart he was doing a clearly fine maneuver, and that should have killed it, but we're still moving. We ought to stop it.

[56 05 45] FLIGHT
Are we using RCS now, Buck?

[56 05 58] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 06 01] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 06 04] GNC
GNC.

[56 06 04 - 56 06 08] FLIGHT
Did you see any problems in quad D HELIUM VALVE? Does that look like that's cleared up?

[56 06 08 - 56 06 10] GNC
Roger, that's cleared up, FLIGHT, we're in good shape.

[56 06 10 - 56 06 12] FLIGHT
Okay. Now, are we using RCS now?

[56 06 12 - 56 06 16] GNC
That's affirmative, we're going to have to switch some thrusters to MAIN A to hold attitude here.
> Because the thrusters required electrical power to operate and MAIN B was dead, a lot of them had to be switched around to the other bus to maintain operation.

[56 06 17 - 56 06 21] FLIGHT
Okay. How much RCS are we using?

[56 06 22 - 56 06 25] GNC
Oh, we've used - our guess 25 pounds.

[56 06 27 - 56 06 31] FLIGHT
Okay. Give me minimum fuel usage configuration that'll keep me attitude.

[56 06 32] GNC
Roger.

[56 06 33] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[56 06 34] FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

[56 06 35 - 56 06 37] TELMU
The LM heater current's become essentially static.

[56 06 38 - 56 06 42] FLIGHT
Roger. Let's solve one problem at a time. Come back to me later on on it.

[56 07 05] CAPCOM
We confirming those numbers?

[56 07 20 - 56 07 22] FLIGHT
Buck, I need that RCS stuff as soon as you can get it.

[56 07 22 - 56 07 24] GNC
Roger, Flight. He's turned off all jets now.

[56 07 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 07 26 - 56 07 27] CAPCOM
Okay, we came up with those numbers, FLIGHT.

[56 07 29 - 56 07 34] FLIGHT
Okay, Sy. Give me your next best thing to try.

[56 07 46] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[56 07 47] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 07 47] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 07 51 - 56 08 04] EECOM
Why don't we try - leave FUEL CELL 2 alone, and just make sure that 1 and 3 are {disconnected from both buses.} And make sure that there's abs - {that there won't be any load on them at all.} And let's see what happens to those cells.
1> n.b. this is shutting off the _output_ electrical circuit of the fuel cells, _not_ the fuel cells themselves, which remain on.
2> Since the fuel cell electricity was produced via a chemical reaction, reducing the electrical output load would reduce the reaction rate, which could have an impact on the problem.

[56 08 06 - 56 08 09] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do? Open-circuit FUEL CELL 1 and 3?

[56 08 09] EECOM
That's affirm, flight.

[56 08 10 - 56 08 20] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, let's recommend we open-circuit FUEL CELL number 1 and number 3 and leave FUEL CELL number 2 as-is.

[56 08 21 - 56 08 29] CAPCOM
Okay, 1 and 3 open-circuit, 2 as-is. And earlier we got a report from them that 1 and 3 were reading {grey} but zero flow.
1> Connected to the circuit. An open circuit would yield a barber pole.

[56 08 29 - 56 08 32] FLIGHT
Yeah - CAPCOM, let's amend that. EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 08 32] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 08 33 -] FLIGHT
Why don't we just open-circuit 1 and make sure we don't have any problems getting that back onto the bus -

[56 08 38] EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT.

[- 56 08 40] FLIGHT
- and just watch it for a while before we make any further moves with 3.
> FLIGHT's caution is probably well-advised here, but the last-minute change is dropped by EECOM; later he still thinks both 1 and 3 have been open-circuited.

[56 08 41] EECOM
Roger.

[56 08 41 - 56 08 44] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. Let's just open-circuit one of those right now.

[56 08 57] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 09 05 - 56 09 07] EECOM
That's roger, FLIGHT. That's the AC problem.

[56 09 08] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 09 16 - 56 09 17] FLIGHT
Crew thinks they're venting something.

[56 09 18] EECOM
I heard it, FLIGHT.

[56 09 28] CAPCOM
Copy that, FLIGHT?
> Pretty much as worked-up as the room gets.

[56 09 29] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 09 33 - 56 09 38] FLIGHT
Okay, let's everybody think of the kinds of things that we'd be venting. GNC, you got anything that looks abnormal in your system?

[56 09 39] GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

[56 09 43 - 56 09 47] FLIGHT
How about you, EECOM? You see anything that - with the instrumentation you've got that could be venting?
> One can imagine EECOM here staring at his readouts and thinking "yes, FLIGHT, everything!"

[56 09 53] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[56 10 01 - 56 10 03] EECOM
Let me look at the system, FLIGHT, as far as the venting is concerned.

[56 10 03 - 56 10 07] FLIGHT
Okay. Let's start scanning. I assume you've called in your backup EECOMs?

[56 10 10] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[56 10 11] EECOM
FLIGHT, say again?

[56 10 12 - 56 10 15] FLIGHT
Have you called in your backup EECOMS now? See if we can get some more brain power on this thing?

[56 10 15] EECOM
We got one here.

[56 10 16] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 10 17] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[56 10 18] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[56 10 18 - 56 10 21] INCO
He's - he's - never mind, he's straightening up a little bit.

[56 10 21] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 10 46 - 56 11 22] FLIGHT
Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. We've got the LM still attached, the LM spacecraft is good, so {if} we need to get back home we've got a LM to do it with. Okay? Let's make sure we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM electrical power with the batteries, or that will cause us to lose the main - the FUEL CELL number 2. We want to keep the O2 and that kind of stuff working, we'd like to have RCS. But we've got the {Command Module system}, so we're in good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessin'.
1> Note the repeated use of "if" here. The severity of the problem was not yet fully understood.
2> As noted elsewhere[ref2 p215], FLIGHT likely meant LM here.

[56 11 47] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 11 50] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[56 11 51 - 56 11 53] GNC
I have some jet configurations for you whenever you need them.

[56 11 54] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 11 57] FLIGHT
Give them to me.

[56 12 01 - 56 12 12] GNC
Okay. Charlie 3, Charlie 4 to MAIN A. Bravo 3 and Bravo 4 to MAIN A. Charlie 1 and Charlie 2 to MAIN A -

[56 12 13] FLIGHT
Standby.

[56 12 21 - 56 12 24] GNC
Yeah; it's all of quad Charlie on MAIN A.

[56 12 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 12 25 - 56 12 27] GNC
Plus Bravo 3 and Bravo 4.

[56 12 29 - 56 12 31] FLIGHT
Now, what are we going to be doing with these, GNC?

[56 12 32 - 56 12 34] GNC
That'll give us one jet in each direction on each axis.

[56 12 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 12 36] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[56 12 36] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[56 12 37 - 56 12 39] GUIDO
He's getting close to gimbal lock.

[56 12 39 - 56 12 48] FLIGHT
CAPCOM - okay, CAPCOM, recommend he bring up C-3, C-4, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2 on MAIN A and advise him he's getting close to gimbal lock.

[56 12 52] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, from FLIGHT.

[56 12 53] GUIDO
Go ahead.

[56 12 53 - 56 13 01] FLIGHT
Could we go to a coarse align on the platform here, so we don't have to use any gas if we need to? We could reorient if necessary.

[56 13 02 - 56 13 05] GUIDO
Roger. I was going to recommend a P52 in a little bit anyway -

[56 13 05 - 56 13 09] FLIGHT
Well, it's going to take a while before we get to the point we're even thinking about a P52.

[56 13 09] GUIDO
Yeah.

[56 13 12 - 56 13 14] FLIGHT
Yeah, it'll coarse align itself there, won't it?

[56 13 17 -] GUIDO
It'll coarse align at -

[56 13 19] FLIGHT
Roger.

[- 56 13 20] GUIDO
- any time itself.

[56 14 10 - 56 14 12] FLIGHT
Okay, EECOM. I'm coming back to you.

[56 14 13 -] EECOM
FLIGHT -

[56 14 14] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[- 56 14 18] EECOM
- I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down.

[56 14 19] FLIGHT
Okay -

[56 14 20 - 56 14 23] EECOM
Let's go down the emergency 1-5.

[56 14 24 - 56 14 28] FLIGHT
You want to power down, let us look at the TM and all that good stuff, and then come back up.

[56 14 29] EECOM
That's affirm.

[56 14 30] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 32 - 56 14 33] FLIGHT
You want OMNI Bravo again?

[56 14 34] INCO
Right.

[56 14 34 - 56 14 36] FLIGHT
On board. OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 42 - 56 14 43] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, recommend OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 47 - 56 14 51] FLIGHT
Okay. What - you want to go to - power down - give me the page.

[56 14 51 - 56 14 57] EECOM
Emergency 1-5, FLIGHT, we'll go down - try to get a delta of 10 amps reduction.

[56 15 14 - 56 15 15] INCO
Okay, we've got OMNI Bravo, FLIGHT.

[56 15 22 - 56 15 25] FLIGHT
EECOM, do you want to go through that again? What do you want to power down to?

[56 15 25 - 56 15 27] EECOM
I want to power down a total of 10 amps, FLIGHT.

[56 15 28 - 56 15 29] FLIGHT
A total of 10 amps.
> You can hear someone (FLIGHT, perhaps?) whistle in amazement at this.

[56 15 30] EECOM
That's affirm.

[56 15 31] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 15 35 - 56 15 43] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we'd recommend emergency power down checklist 1-5, we want to power down a total - a delta of 10 amps from where we are now.

[56 15 44] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 15 45] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[56 15 46 - 56 15 50] GNC
Can we afford to do a PTC first, and then we can shut off all of that stuff with no problems.
> As FLIGHT notes later, this is not a possible request.

[56 15 51 - 56 15 53] FLIGHT
Why? You think you're going to have a thermal problem here?

[56 15 53 - 56 15 55] GNC
Well, we could have - if we stay there too long, or we -

[56 15 56 -] FLIGHT
Okay, we'll run into that one later, Buck -

[56 15 59] GNC
Okay.

[- 56 16 01] FLIGHT
- I want to get our major problems sorted out now.

[56 16 02 - 56 16 04] CAPCOM
You want - you still want 1-5 down to 10 amps?

[56 16 03 - 56 16 07] FLIGHT
1-5 power down a delta of 10 amps, CAPCOM.

[56 16 32] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 16 34] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[56 16 35 - 56 16 37] FLIGHT
You don't want to get fuel cell pumps off, do you?

[56 16 44 - 56 16 47] FLIGHT
Optics power is already off, I believe.

[56 16 47 - 56 16 49] EECOM
We can do that on FUEL CELL number 1, FLIGHT.

[56 16 50 - 56 16 53] FLIGHT
Okay, well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission.
> Kranz himself writes[ref1 p314] that he realized within fifteen minutes that an oxygen tank had exploded and therefore the "mission" referred to here was now survival, not a lunar landing. But it is not clear if the entire room was on this page quite yet.

[56 17 20] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 17 21] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 17 22 - 56 17 24] EECOM
Would you not want to consider going to PTC?
> Echoing GUIDO's suggestion earlier. Still not possible, as FLIGHT points out later.

[56 17 26 - 56 17 29] FLIGHT
Well, why don't we get this problem here resolved, right now -

[56 17 30 -] EECOM
This will aid in power down, I think -

[56 17 32] FLIGHT
Pardon?

[- 56 17 35] EECOM
- this should aid our power down, I'd hope - wouldn't it?

[56 17 37 - 56 17 42] FLIGHT
Well, do you expect that we're going to be in a thermal problem for the next many hours? EECOM?

[56 17 44 - 56 17 46] EECOM
Well, don't know where to say the sun is right now, FLIGHT.

[56 17 47 - 56 17 50] GNC
Well, it's pretty close to quad A right now. Are we -

[56 17 51] EECOM
By 90 degrees?

[56 17 53 - 56 17 56] GNC
I don't know exactly where. It's between A and B, mostly on A.
> He's likely deducing this from temperature sensors in the RCS thruster packages.

[56 18 32] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 18 37] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 18 40] GNC
GNC.

[56 18 42 - 56 18 53] FLIGHT
Buck, I'd prefer not making any unnecessary maneuvers now, or try to use any of the equipment's on board the spacecraft, such things as CMC, that type of stuff until we nail down what our problem is.

[56 18 55 - 56 18 59] GNC
Well, that's why I was recommending PTC because we don't need any of that stuff then; {heaters} or anything else.
1> The RCS system involved warming heaters to ensure everything fired as expected.

[56 18 59 - 56 19 09] FLIGHT
Yeah, but you gotta get the CMC on, and keep it online. And you need a rather precise period of time for redamping there.

[56 19 10 - 56 19 14] GNC
In the order of about twenty minutes to damp out and spin up and then we don't need any of that.

[56 19 18 - 56 19 20] GNC
If we get a good spinup going then we're stable -

[56 19 19 - 56 19 35] FLIGHT
Okay, that might be a good idea. That would buy us some time from a standpoint of reviewing the data. And it would get us back into the - as close to the normal flight plan as we could. How far are we out of attitude right now?

[56 19 38 - 56 19 43] GNC
He's a fair ways out right now, FLIGHT. He'd do another VERB 49 and fly back and then stabilize there.

[56 20 57] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 20 58] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 20 58 - 56 21 11] EECOM
Okay, I need one thing right now. He's powering down, he's down to 41 amps, total spacecraft. I'd like to get my AC 2 BUS back so I can look at O2 TANK 2 PRESSURE. I have no insight into that.

[56 21 12] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 21 13 - 56 21 20] EECOM
Let's get - I guess we can put INVERTER 3 to MAIN A. AC 2.

[56 21 23] EECOM
Let's just do it temporarily -

[56 21 23 - 56 21 29] FLIGHT
Now, let me ask you a question - before you do that would you like to make sure you've got all AC load you don't need isolated from the bus?

[56 21 32 - 56 21 39] EECOM
Nah, it - let's not do that right now, FLIGHT. I think we're in good shape that way. The MAIN A is up high enough where it can handle the inverter.

[56 21 40 - 56 21 46] FLIGHT
Well, the thing that concerns me is starting - is throwing equipment - we had a problem, we don't know the cause of the problem, and -

[56 21 46 - 56 21 58] EECOM
FLIGHT, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells. I hate to put it that way, but - I don't know why we've lost them. It doesn't all tag up. And it's not an instrumentation problem, the best I can tell right now.
> The other shoe drops. 27 minutes past the accident, and the picture is becoming clearer. The situation is dire. Only one fuel cell remains, and the gas for it is leaking slowly out to space.

[56 21 59 - 56 22 13] FLIGHT
Okay, I'll tell you what. {Let's discuss this for just a little bit longer there, Sy.} CAPCOM, start them moving back towards a PTC attitude, let's start him going into his rate damping. I feel it's going to be a relatively long period of time to try and nail down the problem. Go ahead.
1> What Sy is saying is highly consequential. This is dramatized in the film for the sake of informing the audience. But the decision hasn't been made to irreversibly close the reactant valves and thus shut down the fuel cells yet.

[56 22 14 - 56 22 16] CAPCOM
He's asking how do we like his amperage setup right now?

[56 22 19 - 56 22 21] FLIGHT
Are you happy with his power level right now, EECOM?

[56 22 29] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[56 22 30] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 22 31 - 56 22 33] INCO
I'd like to firmly secure the high-gain before he starts getting into PTC.

[56 22 54] GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[56 22 54 - 56 22 58] CAPCOM
GNC? What's firing now? You got something firing?

[56 22 59 - 56 23 01] GNC
Well, we've seen quite a bit of thruster activity.

[56 23 02 - 56 23 06] FLIGHT
Okay, I guess this kills the PTC, too, because we're not going to get into PTC as long as we've got something venting.

[56 23 11 - 56 23 13] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. That agrees with what we're seeing here.

[56 23 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 23 16] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 23 17 - 56 23 19] EECOM
I've got a little correction. Let's put INVERTER 1 on both AC buses, please.
> Earlier he asks for INVERTER 3. Only 1 and 3 could pull power off of MAIN A, and MAIN B is dead.

[56 23 21] FLIGHT
INVERTER 1 on both AC.

[56 23 22 - 56 23 42] EECOM
That's affirm, so I can get some AC BUS power back so I can have some insight into my AC BUS 2 telemetry, especially my cyros, maybe - the venting may be coming from that. And also, I think that the FUEL CELL 2 pumps are on AC 2, and {this will take care of it} without switching the pumps yet.
1> Presumably, he needed the pumps back on.

[56 23 44 - 56 23 46] FLIGHT
Say that again. You think your fuel cell pumps -

[56 23 47 - 56 23 50] EECOM
Yeah. FUEL CELL 2 pumps I think are on AC 2.

[56 23 50 - 56 24 02] FLIGHT
Okay, but according to the checklist, he should have powered - he should have turned those off, right? Now, he said he was down through BMAG number 2 is in WARM UP, so he's already gone through the fuel cell pump stuff.

[56 24 00 - 56 24 02] EECOM
Okay. Good enough.

[56 24 04 - 56 24 08] FLIGHT
Okay, so you want to configure INVERTER 1 on both AC buses.

[56 24 09] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[56 24 21 - 56 24 29] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, I didn't - I was listening to the spacecraft and I didn't pass up INVERTER 3 to MAIN A to AC 2, did you delete that?

[56 24 29 - 56 24 30] FLIGHT
No, we deleted that.

[56 24 31] CAPCOM
Okay.

[56 24 35 - 56 24 40] FLIGHT
You want to put INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. EECOM and CAPCOM, let's do it.

[56 24 40] CAPCOM
Okay.

[56 24 47] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 24 48] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 24 49 - 56 24 50] FLIGHT
Monitor this bear when we switch again -

[56 24 50] EECOM
With you.

[56 25 00 - 56 25 02] FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.

[56 25 03] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[56 25 04] CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

[56 25 04 - 56 25 08] FLIGHT
Will you take a look at the prelaunch data and go through your systems and see if there's anything you've got that may have started venting here?

[56 25 09] CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT.

[56 25 10] TELMU
We'll look.

[56 25 11 - 56 25 14] FLIGHT
Okay. And I want a report on that in about the next fifteen minutes. Quick look type stuff.

[56 25 15] CONTROL
Okay.

[56 25 17] FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

[56 25 18] FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

[56 25 18 - 56 25 20] FDO
We're definitely seeing a vent in the data.

[56 25 20] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 25 28 - 56 25 30] FLIGHT
Roger. We copy that, CAPCOM.

[56 25 37 - 56 25 38] EECOM
Fuel cell - FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 25 38] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 25 39 - 56 25 40] EECOM
FUEL CELL 2 PUMPS to AC 1.

[56 25 41 - 56 25 43] FLIGHT
You want FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.

[56 25 44] EECOM
Affirmative.

[56 25 45 - 56 25 47] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.

[56 26 02] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 26 03] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 26 03 - 56 26 06] FLIGHT
Have you got anybody getting a DLOG on this thing downstairs?
> The beginnings of an effort to trace back the data through the accident and piece together what actually happened.

[56 26 09] FLIGHT
NETWORK, from FLIGHT.

[56 26 10] NETWORK
FLIGHT, NETWORK.

[56 26 11 - 56 26 13] FLIGHT
Bring me up another computer in the RTCC, will you?

[56 26 14 - 56 26 19] NETWORK
We got one machine on the RTCC and we got dual CPs downstairs.

[56 26 19 - 56 26 23] FLIGHT
Okay, I want another machine up in the RTCC and I want a bunch of guys capable of running DLOGs down there.

[56 26 24] NETWORK
Roger that.

[56 26 25 - 56 26 31] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, did you hear them say he's getting some rates? We want to know if he's firing any thrusters?

[56 26 32 - 56 26 34] FLIGHT
Roger. GNC, watch those thrusters, will you?

[56 26 35] GNC
GNC. Say again?

[56 26 36 - 56 26 37] FLIGHT
Have you got any thrusters firing?

[56 26 38 - 56 26 42] GNC
We're looking at that C-3 thruster, FLIGHT. It looks like it stays on most of the time.

[56 26 43 - 56 26 47] FLIGHT
Well, can we turn them all off and see if we've still got the rates or any build-up in rates?

[56 26 48 - 56 26 53] GNC
Well, the rates that we're seeing is opposite to the direction of that thruster, so if anything it's just trying to hold and not quite up to it.
> In other words, the venting is pushing in the opposite direction to C-3's firing so they're fighting, but the venting is stronger and winning.

[56 26 54] FLIGHT
Okay, but -

[56 26 55 - 56 27 02] CAPCOM
He's been trying to counteract the rates with DIRECT. He's been getting a negative pitch and a negative roll.

[56 27 03] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 27 07 - 56 27 11] CAPCOM
But he asked if we were getting some thruster firings that were not being made by him.

[56 27 12 - 56 27 28] FLIGHT
I'll tell you what, GNC can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure out what the equivalent ∆V is we're getting? So that we can see if we can backtrack to see if we can figure out what's venting.
> An elegant physics solution, albeit one that would take some time to pull off. In space, absent any external forces and by basic three-laws Newtonian physics, locating single sources of acceleration is a simple matter of running the numbers through basic physics equations.

[56 27 30 - 56 27 36] FLIGHT
In other words, do - it would seem that we could equate that to {effective thrust and an axis} and then deduce what's venting.
1> A vector, in other words, like you remember from grade school.

[56 27 38] GNC
Roger, we'll give that a try, FLIGHT.
> He sounds impressed.

[56 27 39 - 56 27 42] FLIGHT
Okay. And that might be of interest to the {LM guys.}
1> TELMU and CONTROL.

[56 27 42 - 56 27 44] CAPCOM
He also said it was coming past window number 1.

[56 27 44 - 56 27 45] FLIGHT
Roger, we got that.

[56 27 44 - 56 27 46] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. Need OMNI Charlie.

[56 27 47] FLIGHT
OMNI Charlie, CAPCOM.

[56 27 51 - 56 27 57] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT. What did - okay, we've got two good AC buses. What did all that tell you, now?

[56 27 59 - 56 28 04] EECOM
It tells me that - well, just give me about two more minutes, FLIGHT.

[56 28 04 - 56 28 05] FLIGHT
Okay. Take your time.

[56 28 48 - 56 28 49] FLIGHT
Roger. Concur, CAPCOM.

[56 28 54] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU. We copy.

[56 28 56] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 28 57] FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

[56 28 58] FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

[56 28 59 - 56 29 00] FDO
Two machines in the RTCC.

[56 29 00] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 31 38] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 31 39] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[56 31 40 - 56 31 47] GNC
We would like to turn thruster Alpha 3 on MAIN A and see that'll help control that pitch and at the same time we can turn off Charlie 3 because -

[56 31 47 - 56 31 50] FLIGHT
Okay. Get me some real-time plotting on how we're using RCS here, will you?

[56 31 51 - 56 31 57] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. And in the pitch axis we really don't seem to be using any. And that's why we'd like to go to Alpha and see if that changes it any.

[56 31 58 - 56 31 59] FLIGHT
Okay, now what do you want again?

[56 32 00 - 56 32 01] GNC
Thruster Alpha 3 to MAIN A.

[56 32 06 - 56 32 08] FLIGHT
Alpha 3 to MAIN A.

[56 32 10 - 56 32 12] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to pass that up to the crew, please?

[56 32 18 - 56 32 23] FLIGHT
Give me a gross amount of RCS propellant consumed so far, GNC.

[56 32 24 - 56 32 25] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. It'll take 30 seconds.

[56 32 26] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 32 31 - 56 32 33] GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT. We're still below the limits.

[56 32 34] EECOM
Flight, EECOM.

[56 32 35] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 32 37 -] EECOM
We've really got to get that battery off the line and power down some more. And we've got to get some MAIN B power back so we can build our pressure back up in O2 TANK 1. {It's down to 318psi.}
1> Nominal O2 pressure is around 900psi. Normally, an automated pressure sensing switch would activate a heater as the tank depleted to heat the O2 and keep the pressure around that number. 100psi is a bit of a redline mark, at which point even at minimal load only about 2 hours of useful power could be expected.[ref1 p317]

[56 32 52] FLIGHT
BATTERY -

[- 56 32 56] EECOM
With MAIN B down, we have no heaters in O2 tanks.
> Heaters could be used to increase the pressure even with less gas (good old PV=nRT). But EECOM thinks they are on the dead DC MAIN B bus.

[56 32 56 - 56 32 57] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to power down?

[56 32 58 - 56 33 02] EECOM
Well, where'd he say he got down to? BMAG 2 OFF? Not inclusive?

[56 33 03 - 56 33 05] FLIGHT
That's affirmative. BMAG 2 is in WARM UP.

[56 33 06 - 56 33 10] EECOM
I think we'll go ahead and turn that down - we still have the LM with us, right?

[56 33 10] FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

[56 33 11 - 56 33 18] EECOM
So - if we shut down the SCS we ought to be a little better off, perhaps. I think we ought to press on and go down through BMAG 2 OFF, and get those lights minimum.

[56 33 22 - 56 33 24] FLIGHT
Okay. How much you want to power down? Another 10 amps?

[56 33 25 - 56 33 29] EECOM
Let's get the BMAG off and get the lights down to a minimum. Let's go down two more steps.

[56 33 30 - 56 33 37] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power down a little bit more. Want to get the BMAG off and the lights minimum there.

[56 33 57 - 56 34 02] FLIGHT
Okay, Sy. Now, how long do you want to leave this battery online?

[56 34 03 -] EECOM
I want to try and get it off as quick as I can -

[56 34 04] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 34 05] EECOM
- but I need to get the power down.

[56 34 07 - 56 34 12] EECOM
The crew did report they removed FUEL CELL 3 - they open-circuited it also, didn't they?
> Here's that last-minute change FLIGHT requested earlier that EECOM missed.

[56 34 13] FLIGHT
I don't believe so.

[56 34 14 - 56 34 16] EECOM
FUEL CELL 1 and FUEL CELL 3 should be open-circuited.

[56 34 17 - 56 34 22] CAPCOM
We just had our last call for FUEL CELL 1 open-circuit, and we left FUEL CELL 3 as it was.

[56 34 23 - 56 34 24] EECOM
Let's take this open-circuit, FUEL CELL 3.

[56 34 24 - 56 34 25] FLIGHT
Open-circuit FUEL CELL 3.

[56 34 26] EECOM
Get it off the bus.

[56 34 29] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 34 32 - 56 34 33] FLIGHT
Calling, FLIGHT. Say again?

[56 34 34] GNC
This is GNC, FLIGHT.

[56 34 35] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 34 35 - 56 34 43] GNC
Yeah, we've used a total of about 70 pounds RCS. We'd like to change the jet configurations, see if that'll help us out any.

[56 34 45 - 56 34 46] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to try now?

[56 34 47 - 56 34 52] GNC
We'd like to turn the Bravo jets all to be OFF, and all Delta to MAIN A.

[56 34 55 - 56 34 58] FLIGHT
Turn all Bravo OFF, and Delta to MAIN A, right?

[56 34 58 - 56 35 02] GNC
Roger. That will verify that it isn't a Bravo thruster that's causing the problem with attitudes.

[56 35 04 - 56 35 12] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we'd like to turn all Bravo jets OFF and all Delta jets to MAIN A.

[56 35 14] CAPCOM
Roger.

[56 35 16] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 35 17] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 35 17 - 56 35 20] EECOM
Let's take BATTERY A off the MAIN.

[56 35 20 -] FLIGHT
We can support the -

[56 35 22] EECOM
That's affirm.

[- 56 35 25] FLIGHT
- main now on the one fuel cell even with the cryo O2 going down?

[56 35 26 - 56 35 27] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[56 35 28 - 56 35 30] FLIGHT
Okay. What's your worry level on cryo O2?

[56 35 32 - 56 35 33] EECOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

[56 35 34] FLIGHT
Okay. You want to -

[56 35 35 - 56 35 36] EECOM
I want to save the battery, FLIGHT.

[56 35 37 - 56 35 40] FLIGHT
Okay. Let's see, what battery have we got online, Sy?

[56 35 41] EECOM
Say again?

[56 35 41 - 56 35 42] FLIGHT
What battery have we got online?

[56 35 43] EECOM
BATTERY Alpha, FLIGHT.

[56 35 44 - 56 35 45] FLIGHT
BATTERY A, okay.

[56 35 45 - 56 35 51] EECOM
And next step, of course, we'll then think - we've got to worry about getting some power on MAIN B to get the pressure back up in O2 TANK 1.

[56 35 51 - 56 35 54] FLIGHT
Roger. Turn BATTERY A OFF, CAPCOM.

[56 36 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 36 16] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 36 17 - 56 36 20] EECOM
{Let's have them isolate the surge tank also, and save it.} We'll use the cryo as much as we can.
1> The surge tank provided additional O2, and was located in the Command Module, so it stayed with the crew for the whole flight.

[56 36 23] FLIGHT
Say that again?

[56 36 25 -] EECOM
Let's isolate the surge tanks -

[56 36 26] FLIGHT
Why that?

[- 56 36 27] EECOM
in the Command Module.

[56 36 28 - 56 36 29] FLIGHT
I don't understand that, Sy.

[56 36 29 - 56 36 31] EECOM
I want to use the cryo as much as possible.

[56 36 32 - 56 36 35] FLIGHT
But that would seem to be the opposite, if you want to keep the fuel cell going.

[56 36 36 - 56 36 46] EECOM
The fuel cells are fed off the tanks in the Service Module, FLIGHT. The surge tank is in the Command Module. We want to save the surge tank and use it for re-entry.

[56 36 46 - 56 36 48] FLIGHT
Okay, I'm with you. I'm with you.
> People online seem to be really impressed with this exchange. But if this sort of conversation didn't happen in MCC, we would never have flown anywhere. It's basic teamwork and leadership. Perhaps the reaction says more about the typical manager than about NASA.

[56 36 49] EECOM
Roger.

[56 36 50 - 56 36 53] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's also isolate the surge tank.

[56 36 57 - 56 36 59] CAPCOM
Okay, you want to isolate the surge tank.

[56 37 00] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[56 37 01] CAPCOM
O2 surge tank, right?

[56 37 01 - 56 37 05] FLIGHT
Yeah. What we're really doing is securing our entry systems right now.

[56 37 29 - 56 37 33] FLIGHT
Yeah, we're trying to figure out some way to get {power on BUS B.}
1> Recall that the tank heaters, which are needed to raise the pressure, are thought to be on BUS B which is currently dead.

[56 37 59] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 38 10] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 38 11] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 38 12 - 56 38 15] FLIGHT
Did you consider putting a battery on BUS B long enough to get the presure up?

[56 38 16 - 56 38 27] EECOM
Well, I'm trying - I want to determine whether or not the - the 5 amps is going to hurt us any. That's going to be on MAIN A, incidentally. I made a mistake. {O2 TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A.}
1> Good news, since MAIN B appears to be shot.

[56 38 28 - 56 38 29] FLIGHT
Well, we've got MAIN A with us, haven't we?

[56 38 45] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 38 46] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 38 47 - 56 39 02] EECOM
Okay. Since O2 TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A, and we've got them off now, we'll be able to stand the 5 amps temporarily for {manual pressurization.} Let's have them turn the heaters on manually in O2 TANK 1.
1> As noted previously, the heaters are normally controlled automatically off a pressure sensor. That automated switching highlights the simplicity of the spacecraft's systems; no computers needed to monitor and react to the sensor: it just plugged right into the activation circuit.

[56 39 03 -] FLIGHT
O2 -

[56 39 03 - 56 39 04] EECOM
And we'll watch the pressure.

[- 56 39 05] FLIGHT
- TANK 1.

[56 39 14 - 56 39 15] EECOM
That's CRYOGENIC O2 HEATER 1, FLIGHT.

[56 39 17 - 56 39 19] GNC
FLIGHT, we copy that. No problem.

[56 39 19 - 56 39 20] FLIGHT
No problem, CAPCOM.

[56 39 22 - 56 39 24] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we want to get CRYO O2 TANK number 1 HEATER ON.

[56 39 45 - 56 39 47] FLIGHT
You can stand the 5 amps on MAIN A?

[56 39 47 - 56 39 49] EECOM
That's affirm. We think so, FLIGHT.

[56 40 07 - 56 40 09] FLIGHT
Did you see your 5 amp increase in current there, EECOM?

[56 40 13] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[56 40 14] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 40 14 -] EECOM
26.7 volts, looks good -

[56 40 16] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 40 17] EECOM
 - we'll watch the pressure.

[56 40 18 - 56 40 23] EECOM
FLIGHT, to be consistent we ought to isolate the REPRESS package also.
> The repressurization package, like the O2 surge tank, was a reserve of pressurized oxygen gas in the Command Module.

[56 40 24 - 56 40 26] FLIGHT
Okay, you want to isolate REPRESS pack.

[56 40 40] FLIGHT
AFD, from FLIGHT.

[56 40 43] AFD
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[56 40 43 - 56 40 55] FLIGHT
Get one of your guys full-time in the back room keeping track of the spacecraft configuration as we pass it up to the crew. You might use Larry. Why don't you stay on, get Larry in the back room to keep track of configuration stuff we give to the crew?

[56 40 55] AFD
Okay, FLIGHT.

[56 40 56] FLIGHT
Okay?

[56 40 57 - 56 41 00] AFD
And we've got the voice recorder and we're starting to transcribe that.

[56 41 01 - 56 41 10] FLIGHT
Okay, now has anybody started the DLOG of the initial problem? You've got a DLOG going? Have you got people that are going to be in a position to evaluate it?

[56 41 12] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 41 22 - 56 41 23] FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.

[56 41 25] CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

[56 41 26 - 56 41 28] FLIGHT
Roger. I want LM manning around the clock.

[56 41 29] CONTROL
Roger.

[56 41 30] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 41 31] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 41 32 - 56 41 38] EECOM
I want the fans on in O2 tank 1, we're not seeing a pressure increase. We can stand it.

[56 41 38 - 56 41 39] FLIGHT
You can stand it?

[56 41 40] EECOM
That's affirm.

[56 41 41 - 56 41 42] FLIGHT
Fans on in TANK 1, right?

[56 41 44] EECOM
Affirmative, FLIGHT.

[56 41 46 - 56 41 49] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to bring the fans on in TANK 1?

[56 41 48 - 56 41 49] EECOM
It's just 1 amp, FLIGHT.

[56 41 50] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 41 52 - 56 41 55] EECOM
Okay, he's got an MC/MW?? for - varied reasons.

[56 42 20] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 42 22] FLIGHT
Go ahead, GNC.

[56 42 24 - 56 42 27] GNC
It looks like the vehicle has stabilized considerably over the last few minutes.

[56 42 28 - 56 42 39] FLIGHT
Okay. That could mean one of two things. Either whatever was venting has stopped venting, it's empty; or do you feel it could also be associated with the thruster quad Bravo we just isolated?

[56 42 41 - 56 42 43] GNC
It's possible, FLIGHT. We really don't know yet, though.

[56 42 44 - 56 42 53] FLIGHT
Okay. Are we essentially in - can you figure out what orientation we are from a standpoint of {thermal control?} Assume - what's our rate right now?
1> He's referring to the heat and shadow of the Sun.

[56 42 55 - 56 43 00] GNC
Right now he has a -0.10 of a degree in pitch. And yaw and roll are very close to 0.

[56 43 01] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 43 02] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 43 03] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 43 04 - 56 43 16] EECOM
The pressure in O2 TANK 1 is all the way down to {297}, we'd better think about getting in the LM, or using the LM systems. I'm going to have to power way down; I don't know if I'm going to be able to save the O2 for the third fuel cell - for FUEL CELL 2, rather.
1> PSI. At 56:32:37 it was reported at 312psi.

[56 43 19 - 56 43 23] FLIGHT
{The heaters aren't working, now let's start thinking circuit breakers.} You got any circuit breakers you want to check, there?
1> In other words, FLIGHT is wondering if the heater circuit breaker popped, so despite flipping the switch on, the heaters weren't actually running.

[56 43 27 - 56 43 28] EECOM
We saw the current, FLIGHT.
> EECOM doesn't think the circuit breaker theory is likely, since he saw the load on MAIN A increase by the expected amount for a heater to be running.

[56 43 28 - 56 43 30] FLIGHT
You saw the current - okay, look -

[56 43 32 - 56 43 33] EECOM
Let's check it anyway, FLIGHT, you're right.
> But that could be a coincidence or something else could be wrong, so he comes around.

[56 43 33 - 56 43 38] FLIGHT
{It looks like it's cycling up a PCM count from 297 to 302.} Give me some circuit breakers to check.
> The telemetry refreshed and the pressure increased - by a hair.

[56 43 39 - 56 43 47] EECOM
Okay, panel 226. CRYOGENIC O2 HEATER number 1, MAIN A circuit breaker.

[56 43 48 - 56 43 53] FLIGHT
I'm sorry, I didn't catch you there. CRYO O2 TANK 1? Panel 226?

[56 43 53 - 56 43 56] EECOM
CYRO O2 HEATER 1, MAIN A, panel 226.

[56 43 57] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 43 58 - 56 44 06] EECOM
Also, FLIGHT, let's check the FAN MOTOR circuit breakers TANK 1, on panel 226 also.

[56 44 07] FLIGHT
FAN MOTOR.

[56 44 10 - 56 44 13] EECOM
CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1. There are three circuit breakers - {three phase.}
1> Three-phase alternating current. Motors are easier built on three-phase AC. Unlike the two-phase AC your house gets, three-phase AC works with three wires.

[56 44 17 - 56 44 18] FLIGHT
Get that, CAPCOM?

[56 44 20 - 56 44 27] CAPCOM
I've got the 226 CRYO O2 HEATER 1 MAIN A, and CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1, three of them on -

[56 44 27 - 56 44 28] FLIGHT
That's right. All three phases.

[56 44 31 - 56 44 38] FLIGHT
EECOM, I don't think we're going to come to any solution here until we get back to the initial set of conditions, so I hope you got a set of guys looking at the DLOG pretty soon.

[56 44 49] FLIGHT
TELMU, from FLIGHT.

[56 44 52] TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[56 44 52 - 56 44 57] FLIGHT
I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LM to sustain life.
> The first mention of this critical problem and need on the loop, but it's nearly certain that the back rooms were working on this already.

[56 44 57] TELMU
Roger.

[56 44 58] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 45 18 - 56 45 20] CAPCOM
We got the circuit breakers. {All in,} FLIGHT.
1> The circuit breakers popped out when broken and pushed in when the circuit was closed.

[56 45 22 - 56 45 24] FLIGHT
Roger. Copy, all circuit breakers in.

[56 46 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 46 15] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 46 16 - 56 46 17] EECOM
Don't we have both BMAGs OFF?

[56 46 25 - 56 46 28] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, would you verify that both BMAGs are OFF, please?

[56 46 40 - 56 46 41] FLIGHT
You want to bring it off, right EECOM?

[56 46 43] EECOM
Affirmative, FLIGHT.

[56 46 44] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's get it off.

[56 47 31] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 47 34] CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[56 47 35 - 56 47 45] FLIGHT
Will you get a cockpit panel 1, 2 layout and have the crew - just get the thing and have the crew read across all instruments, all gauges, and write down exactly what they read in those things?
> Panel 3 contained fuel cell readings, which were already being closely monitored, and propellant readings for the SPS, which FLIGHT did not want to use. So there was no need for a survey.

[56 47 47 - 56 47 52] CAPCOM
Okay. You want a survey of panels 1 and 2 on gauges? 

[56 47 53] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[56 47 54 - 56 47 56] CAPCOM
Okay. And talkbacks, huh?

[56 47 57 - 56 48 04] FLIGHT
That's affirmative. Figure out some code that you can use and - I think that's something we should have gotten started a while ago.

[56 48 10] FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

[56 48 20 - 56 48 24] FLIGHT
See that juice is still going down there, EECOM. You got any more suggestions?

[56 48 28] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 48 29 - 56 48 32] FLIGHT
Any more suggestions in trying to pump up O2 TANK 1 pressure?

[56 48 32 - 56 48 42] EECOM
No. FLIGHT, we're gonna hit 100psi in 1 hour and 54 minutes. That's the end, right there.

[56 48 47 - 56 48 48] FLIGHT
Okay, 100psi -

[56 48 49] EECOM
Less than 2 hours, now.

[56 50 56] FLIGHT
FDO, from FLIGHT.

[56 50 57] FDO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[56 50 58 - 56 51 12] FLIGHT
Whatever planning you do, I want to do assuming that we're going around the Moon and we're using the LM for performing maneuvers, because in the present configuration, unless we get a heckuva lot smarter I think we're wasting our time planning and using the SPS.

[56 51 13] FDO
Okay, FLIGHT.

[56 51 14 - 56 51 27] FLIGHT
So I think all of our return-to-Earth type planning should be assuming the use of the LM DPS and/or RCS. And I think third priority down the line should be CSM RCS.

[56 51 27 - 56 51 30] FDO
Okay, and I'm assuming that you want fast-as-possible return.

[56 51 32 - 56 51 34] FLIGHT
Yeah, I think that's the case.

[56 51 34 -] FDO
Okay. We'll work on it from that sideline, FLIGHT -

[56 51 36] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 51 38] FDO
Should be no problem.

[56 51 38] GUIDO
I copy that, FLIGHT.

[56 51 46] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 51 48] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 51 49 - 56 52 20] EECOM
Okay, listen. There is a possibility that we blew a O2 line in one of the fuel cells, and {it's effectively manifolded there}, of course. Now, I'm - I want to shut off one of the reactant valves to one of the fuel cells. And that would be FUEL CELL 3, since its O2 pressure is gone. Now, FUEL CELL 1's O2 pressure is trying to stay up there, at 45psi. Maybe the problem is in FUEL CELL 3.
1> In other words, both tanks run into this line.

[56 52 24 - 56 52 26] FLIGHT
That sounds like a good assumption, right there.

[56 52 26 - 56 52 29] EECOM
Yeah. FUEL CELL 3 is lost anyways, FLIGHT.

[56 52 29] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 52 30] FLIGHT
Go ahead, GNC.

[56 52 31 - 56 52 32] GNC
Turn Charlie 1 thruster OFF.

[56 52 34 - 56 52 35] FLIGHT
You want to turn Charlie 1 OFF? Why?

[56 52 36 - 56 52 39] GNC
Well, looks like we're getting a lot of firing out for no reason.

[56 52 41 - 56 52 46] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM, recommend THRUSTER C-1 to off.

[56 52 56] CAPCOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

[56 52 57 - 56 52 58] FLIGHT
THRUSTER C-1 to OFF.

[56 53 00] CAPCOM
C-1 and -2 OFF.

[56 53 01 - 56 53 09] FLIGHT
No. C-1. OFF. I added a word in there. Turn THRUSTER C-1 OFF.

[56 53 25] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 53 26] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 53 27 - 56 53 28] FLIGHT
Why don't you show me where you think that problem is?

[56 53 29] EECOM
Okay. Clint's coming up.

[56 55 16] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 55 23] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.
> This is actually Glynn Lunney responding, who was preparing for his shift. He spent some time before his team came on circulating the consoles and issuing a single critical question to each that had to be answered in the following half hour.

[56 55 24 - 56 55 29] EECOM
We need to get the - make sure the inline heaters for FUEL CELLS 1 and 3 are OFF.

[56 55 50] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 55 51] EECOM
FLIGHT.

[56 55 52 - 56 55 54] FLIGHT
You want to shut off both reactant valves to FUEL CELL number 3?

[56 55 54 - 56 55 55] EECOM
It's dead anyway, FLIGHT.

[56 55 56] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 55 56 - 56 55 59] EECOM
And the inline heaters OFF in FUEL CELLS 1 and 3, please.

[56 56 00 - 56 56 30] FLIGHT
What we're proposing here - supposing here, CAPCOM, is we may have a - had some problem in FUEL CELL number 3 since that's the one that's reading no O2 right now. And we may be losing our O2 through FUEL CELL number 3, the O2 manifold - inasmuch as they're manifolded together commonly. Looks like the O2 in FUEL CELL 1 and 2 seem to be trying to stay up there. And FUEL CELL 3 looks like it's the oddball here.

[56 56 42 - 56 56 48] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, let's close the REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.

[56 56 49 - 56 56 51] CAPCOM
Okay, close REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.

[56 56 53 - 56 56 56] CAPCOM
And you're saying that 1 and 2 look okay?

[56 56 57 - 56 57 03] FLIGHT
Well, what it looks like - looks like the pressure's trying to stay up there and this is the best guess we've got right now because we've got to stop this O2 flow.

[56 57 04] CAPCOM
Okay.

[56 57 13] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 57 14] FLIGHT
GO, GNC.

[56 57 15 - 56 57 17] GNC
Some more jet reconfigurations to see if we can hold the attitude.

[56 57 18] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 57 19 - 56 57 20] GNC
We'd like to turn Charlie 2 OFF -

[56 57 20 - 56 57 26] FLIGHT
Wait, why are we interested in holding attitude? If we're not venting why not drift for a while? That would probably be better from a standpoint of thermal control anyway, wouldn't it?

[56 57 28 - 56 57 31] GNC
I'd think we'd like to get into a controlled drift rather than just some random thing, FLIGHT.

[56 57 34] FLIGHT
Standby.

[56 57 55 - 56 57 59] FLIGHT
Do you want them to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown, Sy? I assume you do - heaters and all?

[56 58 01] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[56 58 03 - 56 58 05] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT. He's gone through much of it already, got the pumps off.

[56 58 06 - 56 58 10] FLIGHT
Okay. You want them to go through the whole fuel cell shutdown. Heaters and all.

[56 58 10 - 56 58 12] EECOM
Heaters, reactant valves, and the pumps of course he's already done.

[56 58 13 - 56 58 14] FLIGHT
Okay. Go ahead, CAPCOM.

[56 58 15 - 56 58 18] EECOM
And get the inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1 also, FLIGHT.

[56 58 19 - 56 58 21] FLIGHT
Inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1.

[56 58 21 - 56 58 23] EECOM
Roger, it'll cut the current requirement down, anyway.

[56 58 55 - 56 58 57] CAPCOM
The comms holding up? Sounds like he's going out.

[56 58 58 - 56 59 01] FLIGHT
How you doing there, INCO? From a standpoint of OMNI-switching?

[56 59 02 - 56 59 03] INCO
We might be a little better on Bravo.

[56 59 04 - 56 59 10] FLIGHT
Okay. Can you figure me out some way to keep communications and yet cut down a bit on the load? You might talk to EECOM on it.

[56 59 11 - 56 59 13] INCO
Okay. We can turn the tape recorder OFF.

[56 59 14] FLIGHT
EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 59 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 59 16 - 56 59 17] FLIGHT
You don't need the tape recorder, do you?

[56 59 17 - 56 59 18] EECOM
Heck, no. Get it off.

[56 59 18] FLIGHT
Let's get it off.

[56 59 21 - 56 59 24] INCO
It may be already off, but that's one thing we don't need.

[56 59 24 - 56 59 30] EECOM
Let's go down the list as much of that INCO stuff as we can get, FLIGHT. I think that's about the one biggie right there.

[56 59 30 - 56 59 33] INCO
Is that the only thing we can give up? We turn the POWER AMPS OFF, we won't get high-bitrate.

[56 59 35] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 59 36] CAPCOM
Go.

[56 59 37 - 56 59 39] FLIGHT
Let's also verify tape recorders OFF, please.

[56 59 40 - 56 59 41] CAPCOM
Okay, I think we -

[56 59 42 - 56 59 48] FLIGHT
I don't think we got down that far on the list, did we? We went through the BMAGs and that was lights - BMAGs and lights, and I think we stopped right there.

[56 59 50 - 56 59 54] EECOM
Yeah, that's affirm, FLIGHT. Tape record - we'll skip a step and go tape recorder OFF.

[57 00 12 - 57 00 14] RECOVERY
AFD, meet RECOVERY. RECOVERY loop.

[57 00 18 - 57 00 19] FLIGHT
What was that, CAPCOM?

[57 00 22 - 57 00 23] GUIDO
We copy, FLIGHT.

[57 00 23 - 57 00 24] FLIGHT
What was that, GUIDANCE?

[57 00 25 - 57 00 28] GUIDO
He had an 06 18 he couldn't get rid of; he's got rid of it now.

[57 01 04] FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

[57 01 17 - 57 01 26] CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. I had them reading off a lot of gauge readings, and we got over to FUEL CELL 3. And I hope your people were copying all this down.

[57 01 27 - 57 01 32] FLIGHT
Did you get some kind of master? We got it on tape, I'm sure we can get it off the tape.

[57 01 32 - 57 01 36] CAPCOM
Alright. That's affirm. I'd say I have 95 percent of the ones he read.

[57 01 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 02 18] FDO
FLIGHT, FDO.

[57 02 19] FLIGHT
Go, FDO.

[57 02 20 - 57 02 24] FDO
When the systems men can stand it, I need two minutes for a checkpoint to save all this data.

[57 02 26 - 57 02 32] FLIGHT
I don't see why we couldn't - EECOM, GNC, can you stand a checkpoint right now?

[57 02 36 - 57 02 38] EECOM
It only takes a minute, I guess I'll have to if we need it, FLIGHT.

[57 02 38] GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 02 39 - 57 02 41] FLIGHT
Yeah, I think it'd be good to get a checkpoint. Go ahead.

[57 02 42 - 57 02 47] FLIGHT
EECOM, have you deduced anything - have you seen your REACTANT VALVES go off? You seen flow cease?

[57 02 51] EECOM
Can't tell, FLIGHT.

[57 02 52] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 02 52 - 57 02 58] EECOM
They were open-circuited, and the pressure - still appears to be going down.

[57 02 59] FLIGHT
Yup.

[57 03 27] FDO??
Negative, FLIGHT.

[57 03 37] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 03 38] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[57 03 39 - 57 03 46] EECOM
We'd better confirm that the FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT VALVE circuit breaker on panel 226 was closed when he shut those.

[57 03 47 - 57 03 50] FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT circuit breaker and what panel?

[57 03 51] EECOM
226.

[57 03 54] EECOM
They're normally open.
> To avoid accidental shutoff of the reactant valves, the electrically activated shutoff valves were normally open-circuited and had to be closed in order for the shutoff switch to actually do anything.

[57 03 58 - 57 03 59] FLIGHT
Okay, good idea.

[57 04 00 -] CAPCOM
You want them - close the circuit breaker -

[57 04 02] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[- 57 04 03] CAPCOM
- on the valve, and then -

[57 04 03] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 04 05 - 57 04 07] EECOM
Yeah, FLIGHT; he should have gotten a barber pole on that.

[57 04 17 - 57 04 21] FLIGHT
Yeah, wouldn't he get a barber pole when he turned the reactants off? EECOM?

[57 04 22] EECOM
Affirm, FLIGHT.

[57 04 24 - 57 04 26] FLIGHT
Even with the circuit breaker open?

[57 04 26] EECOM
No -

[57 04 26 - 57 04 30] FLIGHT
No. Okay, so he ought to know that. We can just verify that he got a -
> The rest of the sentence here would have been "barber pole."

[57 04 35 - 57 04 36] FDO
Okay, FLIGHT. We have our checkpoint.

[57 04 37 - 57 04 49] FLIGHT
Okay. All flight controllers, I'd suggest you start handing over, because I think a fresh team's probably going to be thinking clearer. I think the rest of us can continue working in some other function in support of the new team coming on.

[57 04 49 - 57 04 50] GNC
Go on thruster A-4, FLIGHT.

[57 04 51 - 57 04 53] FLIGHT
Okay. Go on thruster A-4, CAPCOM.

[57 04 52] INCO
OMNI Charlie, FLIGHT.

[57 04 53 - 57 04 54] FLIGHT
Roger. And OMNI Charlie.

[57 06 13 - 57 06 50] FLIGHT
Okay. All flight controllers, I'm handing over to Glynn. I assume the majority of all the team guys are pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can. Now what I'd suggest is the {white team} do two things: they go over the DLOGs - okay - let me go back over this again. We're handing over to Glynn. I'd suggest the white team goes back and starts going through the DLOG of the data. In other words, let's see if we can go back to the initial conditions and work on that problem to see if we can find out what happened and we may find some better clues as to what to do and let the fresh guys come on and try to figure out where do we go from here.
1> Kranz's team was the white team. Glynn headed up black team.

[57 06 53 - 57 06 56] FLIGHT
And the DLOG is in way now. Roger.

[57 07 14 - 57 07 19] FLIGHT
Okay, EECOM. {Tell me about the latch.} Do you think you've got the reactants latched?
1> FLIGHT is following up on the possibility that the reactant valve didn't close. There was, in addition to the breaker, a latch that could wedge it open to prevent it from closing in case of heavy vibration, as could happen during a burn.

[57 07 20] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 07 21] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 07 22 - 57 07 36] EECOM
The crew reported he got barber pole whenever he threw the reactant switch, so that implies that he did all the right things and he really got it shut off. And it looks like that didn't help us any - the pressure's not improving any.

[57 07 37 - 57 07 41] FLIGHT
Okay, now the next question is: are you willing to do that on FUEL CELL number 1?

[57 07 42 - 57 07 46] EECOM
That's the question we're pondering, FLIGHT. We've got to come up with an answer on that one.

[57 07 47 - 57 07 49] FLIGHT
Soon. FUEL CELL 2 is working okay.

[57 07 50] EECOM
That's affirm.

[57 07 51 - 57 07 55] FLIGHT
Unless we do something to get that oxygen, it's not going to do us any good to save fuel cells.
> In other words, there's no reason to be reluctant to shut off another fuel cell if there won't be any oxygen to feed into the working one anyway. You can already see how much more Lunney opines on debates.

[57 07 56] EECOM
That's affirmative.

[57 07 57 - 57 07 59] FLIGHT
Okay - okay. GNC, FLIGHT.

[57 08 01] GNC
GNC.

[57 08 02 - 57 08 04] FLIGHT
You stabilized now? - standby.

[57 08 06 - 57 08 08] FLIGHT
Here comes configuration, I think it's yours.

[57 08 34 - 57 08 36] FLIGHT
I didn't copy all those; did you, GNC?

[57 08 36 - 57 08 37] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We concur.

[57 08 38 - 57 08 40] FLIGHT
Is that good? How are the rates?

[57 08 41 - 57 08 42] CAPCOM
You copy those, GNC?

[57 08 42 - 57 08 44] GNC
It's holding down around a tenth of a degree per second, FLIGHT.

[57 08 45] FLIGHT
Isolating. ??

[57 08 46 - 57 08 47] GNC
He's in ACCEL CMD, so -

[57 08 50] FLIGHT
ACCEL CMD?

[57 08 51] GNC
Right.

[57 08 53] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 08 57 - 57 08 58] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, did you copy all those thrusters?

[57 08 59 - 57 09 01] FLIGHT
Go ahead. Who's calling?

[57 09 02] CAPCOM
CAPCOM. Did you copy all those -

[57 09 03 - 57 09 05] FLIGHT
I didn't copy them all, Jack. GNC, did you copy them all?

[57 09 06 - 57 09 07] GNC
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[57 09 07 - 57 09 08] FLIGHT
Do you like that configuration for right now?

[57 09 09] GNC
Yes.

[57 09 10 - 57 09 17] FLIGHT
As best you can tell - best you can tell, the rates are okay. And he's flying ACCEL CMD.

[57 09 19] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

[57 09 20 - 57 09 21] FLIGHT
No rate damping, then, right?

[57 09 22] GNC
Roger.

[57 09 24 - 57 09 26] FLIGHT
Are both BMAG packages off?

[57 09 27] GNC
Yes, they are.

[57 09 29] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 09 45 - 57 09 48] FLIGHT
Standby. EECOM, you need anything?

[57 09 51] EECOM
Roger, FLIGHT. We'll take those.

[57 09 53] CAPCOM
We want those?

[57 09 55] EECOM
Roger.

[57 09 57] FLIGHT
What do you want?

[57 09 59 -] EECOM
Get him to go through the meters -

[57 10 00] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 57 10 01] EECOM
- on FUEL CELL 1 and 3.

[57 10 02 - 57 10 03] FLIGHT
Okay. Just FUEL CELL 1 and 3, Jack.

[57 11 25 - 57 11 31] FLIGHT
EECOM, I don't like the way that O2 pressure's going down. If you want to do something about these other reactant valves, let's make up our mind.

[57 11 31] EECOM
Okay.

[57 11 32] FLIGHT
Don't you think?

[57 11 32 - 57 11 35] EECOM
Let me get that for you in a minute, FLIGHT. Let's standby on these readouts.

[57 11 36 - 57 11 40] FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. Anybody can copy the readouts. Be sure you're discussing these reactants.

[57 11 54 - 57 12 02] CAPCOM
Hey, FLIGHT. CAPCOM. Long time ago I heard someone mention something about closing the REPRESS package and then we never made a decision on that. Do they want to do that, too?

[57 12 03 - 57 12 04] FLIGHT
EECOM? - he's busy.

[57 12 06] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 12 07 - 57 12 11] FLIGHT
Do you want to close out the REPRESS pack? I think that came on for them before.

[57 12 12 - 57 12 14] EECOM
We indicated earlier that we'd like to get it closed -

[57 12 14] FLIGHT
Yes, Jack.

[57 12 23] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 12 24] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 12 25 - 57 12 42] EECOM
Okay, on the reactant - FUEL CELL 1. Seems to me we have no choice but to go ahead and do it. The pressure continues to drop. We're not going to have anything left soon anyway. So, looks like the next best thing to try is to go ahead and turn the reactants OFF on FUEL CELL 1.

[57 12 43 - 57 12 46] FLIGHT
Yeah. What is this pounds on your display, Clint?

[57 12 47] EECOM
On O2?

[57 12 48] FLIGHT
Yup.

[57 12 49 - 57 12 51] EECOM
That's - that's invalid.

[57 12 52] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 12 57 - 57 13 03] EECOM
And of course, you'll want to make sure that his circuit breaker is closed for FUEL CELL 1 when he starts to close the reactant valves.

[57 13 04 - 57 13 05] FLIGHT
Which circuit breaker is that; the one on 226?

[57 13 06] EECOM
Roger.

[57 13 10 - 57 13 11] FLIGHT
That's FUEL CELL number 1.

[57 13 12 - 57 13 13] EECOM
That's right, FUEL CELL reactants number 1.

[57 13 14] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 13 16 - 57 13 17] EECOM
Is he done with that readout yet?

[57 13 20 - 57 13 23] EECOM
I didn't copy the last part of it, FLIGHT -

[57 13 32 - 57 13 33] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 13 34] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 13 34 - 57 13 43] FLIGHT
Is there any chance that I'm just looking at a bad pressure reading here? I'm going to shut off the second fuel cell now, is there any data you can correlate that says that yeah, that pressure is going down?

[57 13 45 - 57 13 46] EECOM
On the O2 tank?

[57 13 46] FLIGHT
Yes.

[57 13 51 - 57 13 52] FLIGHT
You understand my question?

[57 13 52 - 57 14 00] EECOM
I understand your question. The temperatures are also dropping. Let me get a verification on that - standby just a minute.
> Ideal gas law PV=nRT can help verify the two readings against each other.

[57 14 00] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 14 15 - 57 14 18] FLIGHT
Yeah, we copy that. Tell them we're debating shutting off the reactants on 1.

[57 14 19] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 14 19] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 14 20 - 57 14 21] EECOM
The temperature is the only thing we have.

[57 14 22] FLIGHT
And does it correlate?

[57 14 23] EECOM
Pretty closely.

[57 14 24 - 57 14 27] FLIGHT
You're saying that I'm looking at a valid pressure in that tank, and it's still going down.

[57 14 28] EECOM
That's the way it looks, FLIGHT.

[57 14 29] FLIGHT
Therefore?

[57 14 30 - 57 14 33] EECOM
Therefore we need to go to FUEL CELL 1 and turn off the reactants.

[57 14 34 - 57 14 37] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 1 reactants. Circuit breaker and a switch.

[57 14 38 - 57 14 41] CAPCOM
Okay - you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?

[57 14 42] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[57 14 43] EECOM
Say again, FLIGHT?

[57 14 43 - 57 14 45] FLIGHT
Do you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?

[57 14 47] EECOM
That's affirmative.

[57 14 48] FLIGHT
Yes, Jack.

[57 14 50] CAPCOM
Because -

[57 14 51 - 57 14 56] FLIGHT
Because the tank 1 is still going down. Pressure and temp - pressure going down, temperature confirms it.

[57 14 57] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 15 05] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 15 06] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 15 07 - 57 15 09] FLIGHT
Of course, you want to ask yourself if you want to open 3.
> Open-circuit FUEL CELL 3, perhaps?

[57 15 13] EECOM
Open 3?

[57 15 14 - 57 15 15] FLIGHT
Yeah. You don't want to do that?

[57 15 16 - 57 15 18] EECOM
No, we can leave 3 like it is. ??

[57 15 26] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[57 15 28] FLIGHT
Standby.

[57 15 31 - 57 15 32] FLIGHT
What MAIN BUS do you want up?

[57 15 33] EECOM
MAIN A.

[57 15 34] FLIGHT
Just like we -

[57 15 34] EECOM
Just like it is.

[57 15 35 - 57 15 37] FLIGHT
Just like it is. FUEL CELL 2's on MAIN A.

[57 15 39] EECOM
That's affirm.

[57 15 41] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[57 15 41] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 15 42] INCO
OMNI Bravo.

[57 15 45 - 57 15 46] FLIGHT
OMNI Bravo, too, Jack.

[57 16 01] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 16 03] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 16 04 - 57 16 07] FLIGHT
How long can I leave that stuff off and still turn it back on? Any time at all?

[57 16 08 - 57 16 11] EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT. It's like it wipes it out.
> As dramatized in the film, once the fuel cells are shut off they're done for good.

[57 16 12] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 16 20] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 16 23 - 57 16 26] FLIGHT
I don't know. That's what I'm asking, but we've got that shut off now.

[57 16 31 - 57 16 32] FLIGHT
Okay. When you can.

[57 17 07] EECOM
That's right, FLIGHT.

[57 17 08 - 57 17 10] FLIGHT
You're ready for that now. Sure, absolutely, huh EECOM?

[57 17 11] EECOM
That's it, FLIGHT.

[57 17 12 - 57 17 16] FLIGHT
It's still going down and it's not possible that thing is sort of bottoming out, is it?

[57 17 17 - 57 17 22] EECOM
Well, the rate is slower but we have a little less pressure too, so we would expect it to be a little bit slower.

[57 17 23 - 57 17 25] FLIGHT
You are sure, then; you want to close it.

[57 17 26 - 57 17 27] EECOM
Seems to me we have no choice, FLIGHT.

[57 17 31] FLIGHT
Well.

[57 17 33 - 57 17 36] EECOM
Standby one minute; our ?? went down again. One more.

[57 17 50 - 57 17 51] EECOM
We're go on that, FLIGHT.

[57 17 52 - 57 17 54] FLIGHT
Okay. That's your best judgement; we think we ought to close that off, huh?

[57 17 55] EECOM
That's affirmative.

[57 17 56 - 57 18 01] FLIGHT
It's dropping down to {234}. Yeah. Okay. FUEL CELL 1 REACTANTS coming OFF.
1> psi.

[57 18 20] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[57 18 21] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 18 22 - 57 18 30] GNC
I think we can help the CMP a bit if we can tell them to enable BD ROLL in the DAP. He's got AC turned OFF and he's got AC selected in the DAP. Can we tell him to -

[57 18 31 - 57 18 32] FLIGHT
Is he under DAP control?

[57 18 32 -] GNC
Well, he goes to it occasionally -

[57 18 34] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 57 18 36] GNC
- he's in - RATE CMD right - ACCEL CMD right now, but -

[57 18 36 - 57 18 40] FLIGHT
Okay. Okay. He's got AC off, huh?

[57 18 40] GNC
Right.

[57 18 41 - 57 18 46] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, when you get a spare minute there, Jack needs to enable BD ROLL in the DAP if he wants to use it.

[57 18 47 - 57 18 49] FLIGHT
If he wants to use the DAP, that is.

[57 18 55 - 57 18 56] FLIGHT
Jeez, it's really going down.

[57 19 18] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 19 18] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 19 19 - 57 19 25] EECOM
Okay, is the - LM gotten all set up for using LM systems for supporting the CSM?

[57 19 26] TELMU??
That's affirmative.

[57 19 27] FLIGHT
Yes.

[57 19 28 - 57 19 31] EECOM
Okay. We'll get you time as to what it looks like we'll have for power here, shortly.

[57 19 33 - 57 19 35] FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL, FLIGHT.

[57 19 35] CONTROL
CONTROL here.

[57 19 37 - 57 19 39] FLIGHT
Keep reminding me of that heater; now I don't want to let that thing go to long.

[57 19 40 - 57 19 48] CONTROL
Okay. We're still trying to get some data - substantiating data on that, FLIGHT. My own personal opinion is the sooner we can take care of that, the better off I'm going to feel about it.

[57 19 49 - 57 19 50] FLIGHT
Yeah, okay, Hal. Go get 'em.

[57 19 51 - 57 19 56] TELMU
Okay; and FLIGHT, TELMU. We're working on a procedure right now that powers the LM internally from it's own power.

[57 19 57 - 57 19 58] FLIGHT
Yes. Fine.

[57 19 58] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[57 19 59] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 19 59 - 57 20 03] INCO
Save you a little more power to turn the HIGH-GAIN antenna switch to OFF.

[57 20 03 - 57 20 04] FLIGHT
HIGH-GAIN antenna OFF?

[57 20 05] INCO
POWER switch OFF.

[57 20 06 - 57 20 08] FLIGHT
POWER switch. You're doing okay on the OMNIs, huh?

[57 20 09 - 57 20 10] INCO
Yes. We've got the 210s.

[57 20 11 - 57 20 16] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, he can turn the HIGH-GAIN antenna POWER switch OFF; we're doing fine on the OMNIs. We've got the big dish.

[57 20 17] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 20 17] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 20 18] EECOM
Let's charge BATTERY A.

[57 20 19 - 57 20 25] FLIGHT
Yeah, I was wondering about that. Do you - let me get the HIGH-GAIN POWER off first, okay? Clint?

[57 20 25] EECOM
Okay.

[57 20 33 - 57 20 35] FLIGHT
How ?? amps will that give us, EECOM?

[57 20 35 - 57 20 42] EECOM
About 1.3, 1.4 amps - amp-hours per hour. The cost is about 4 and a half amps.

[57 20 43 - 57 20 44] FLIGHT
So it's no big deal on the amps.

[57 20 44 - 57 20 48] EECOM
That's right. And we'd like to use whatever time we have to put energy back into the battery.

[57 20 50 - 57 20 52] FLIGHT
Yeah, and I see O2 tank 1 pressure is 217.

[57 20 53 - 57 20 54] EECOM
That's affirm. It's still coming down.

[57 20 55] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[57 20 57 - 57 20 58] CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT - standby.

[57 21 08 - 57 21 10] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, you want anything done with the CMC right now?

[57 21 11 - 57 21 15] GUIDO
FLIGHT, we would like a VERB 74 before they power it down.

[57 21 15] FLIGHT
VERB 74, CAPCOM.

[57 21 16 - 57 21 17] CAPCOM
You ready for it now?

[57 21 18 - 57 21 21] GUIDO
Standby, FLIGHT, let me the flight - site configured.

[57 21 30] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 21 32] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 21 33 - 57 21 35] FLIGHT
Does the temperature in tank 2 correspond with the pressure reading?

[57 21 36 - 57 21 37] EECOM
Let me see how close it is, FLIGHT

[57 21 50 -] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE -

[57 21 50] FLIGHT
Go.

[- 57 21 51] GUIDO
- we're ready.

[57 21 52 - 57 21 53] FLIGHT
You have VERB 74 you want?

[57 21 54] GUIDO
Roger.

[57 21 55] FLIGHT
VERB 74.

[57 22 00] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 22 00] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 22 01 - 57 22 06] EECOM
Temperature and pressure correspond - they verify that the pressure reading's right.

[57 22 07] FLIGHT
In tank 2?

[57 22 13 - 57 22 14] EECOM
That's right, FLIGHT. Tank 2.

[57 22 14 - 57 22 21] FLIGHT
Okay. Now, is it possible that we still have that tank and it's good? And we could somehow get power on {B} and use it?
1> MAIN DC BUS B

[57 22 22 - 57 22 24] EECOM
Not likely, FLIGHT.

[57 22 24 - 57 22 25] FLIGHT
What's not likely, Clint?

[57 22 25 - 57 22 29] EECOM
Not likely for it to be able to - actually have anything left in the tank.

[57 22 31] FLIGHT
You don't think so?

[57 22 32 - 57 22 35] EECOM
I don't think so, but let's - we'll pulse (?) that one to you.

[57 22 35] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 22 35 - 57 22 38] EECOM
Let me get you a time it looks like we've got on tank 1 here.

[57 22 38] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 22 57] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[57 22 58] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 22 59 - 57 23 11] FLIGHT
Is there anything simple that we can refer the crew to to get them thinking about using the LM here? Have you got anything - checklist, paperwork that'll describe to them what your intentions are?

[57 23 12 - 57 23 18] TELMU
Negative, there's nothing documented in contingency. We're thinking about using the LM as a lifeboat, we have some procedures here. On the ground, though.

[57 23 19 - 57 23 22] FLIGHT
I'm sure you do. What do they amount to? Flying with the tunnel open?

[57 23 23 - 57 23 27] TELMU
Roger. Just a LM, low power - low - supplying power to the CSM.

[57 23 28 - 57 23 29] FLIGHT
Supplying power to the CSM?

[57 23 30 - 57 23 31] TELMU
Yes; about 5 amps.

[57 23 33] FLIGHT
To what?

[57 23 35 - 57 23 36] TELMU
To their {MAIN BUS B}.
1> Which hasn't actually functioned since the accident.

[57 23 37 - 57 23 45] FLIGHT
Okay. Where did - well, MAIN B is in bad shape. We don't have anything on MAIN B right now. What's that power for? TELMU?

[57 23 47 - 57 23 48] TELMU
Just anything they might need it for.

[57 23 49 - 57 23 50] FLIGHT
GNC and EECOM?

[57 23 50] ???
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 23 51 - 57 23 52] FLIGHT
What power do you need from the LM?

[57 24 01] FLIGHT
That's right.

[57 24 02] EECOM
We confirm that here.

[57 24 07 - 57 24 09] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. Looks like we've got about 40 minutes left in that tank.

[57 24 12] EECOM
That's affirm.

[57 24 13] FLIGHT
Yes.

[57 24 16 - 57 24 18] EECOM
Like to get battery 1 charged, FLIGHT.

[57 24 21] FLIGHT
Now -

[57 24 45 - 57 24 52] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, just for his information we're not going to do a DPS burn until we hook around the Moon. Let them know that. And that's at about 79 +30.
> This later turns out to be incorrect. FLIGHT is thinking of the PC+2 burn to send the spacecraft home from the far side of the Moon, but one correction burn ends up happening before then.

[57 25 24] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[57 25 24] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 25 25 - 57 25 29] GUIDO
We didn't get a good recording on that VERB 74, we'll need them to do it again.

[57 25 31] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 25 31] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 25 32 - 57 25 40] EECOM
We'd like to get BATTERY A on charge, and we'd like to go ahead and get some more power off if we can. I'm not sure what the situation is on getting the computer up -

[57 25 40 - 57 25 50] FLIGHT
Clint, let me ask you now, is there anything you want to do - trying to pump up the other tank? Anything? Are you satisfied that both of these tanks are going down and we're past helping them? Even with batteries? That's what I'm getting at.

[57 25 53 - 57 25 56] FLIGHT
I'm trying to be sure that you're satisfied that there's nothing else we can do.

[57 25 57 - 57 26 02] EECOM
About all we can do is power down and let heat leak help us some - which is probably going to be trivial.

[57 26 03 - 57 26 05] FLIGHT
Okay. There's nothing else you want to try.

[57 26 07 - 57 26 13] FLIGHT
That's the only reason I'm delaying on this BATTERY A charge, Clint; to be sure you've gone through everything and you don't have any other tricks up your sleeve.

[57 26 13 - 57 26 14] EECOM
Sure don't, FLIGHT.

[57 26 15 - 57 26 17] FLIGHT
Okay, what are other power do you want to take off before we start the charge?

[57 26 18 - 57 26 23] EECOM
Well, looks like we're going to get into the control area. Whatever they can give up we'll have to come up with, here.

[57 26 23 - 57 26 25] FLIGHT
Okay, are you ready to go ahead and charge BATTERY A?

[57 26 26] EECOM
That's affirmative.

[57 26 26 - 57 26 28] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, why don't they get all they can in BATTERY A?

[57 26 29 - 57 26 35] CAPCOM
Okay, and Jack also asked me if we wanted to get a P52 and get the LM platform up with the -

[57 26 35 - 57 26 37] FLIGHT
What do you think of that? GUIDANCE?

[57 26 38] GUIDO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 26 39 - 57 26 48] FLIGHT
CONTROL. Question is, do you want to do a quick P52 on the CSM so that we can do an align to the LM? I don't know if we want to keep that LM platform up all that time anyway.

[57 26 47 - 57 26 51] CONTROL
That's too much power in my mind, FLIGHT, to keep that thing running for all that time.

[57 26 51 - 57 26 52] FLIGHT
Okay, therefore you don't -

[57 26 53] CONTROL
My vote is not to do that.

[57 26 54] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 26 55] GUIDO
Mine, too.

[57 26 56 - 57 27 01] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM, we don't see any need in doing that, because we wouldn't be using the LM platform until about 79 hours.

[57 27 03 - 57 27 08] CAPCOM
Okay, you don't want to worry about the LM platform. We'll align it later with the AOT, huh?

[57 27 11] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[57 27 16] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 27 41 - 57 27 42] FLIGHT
Did you say BATTERY A charge?

[57 27 42] CAPCOM
Yup.

[57 27 43 - 57 27 45] FLIGHT
Okay. EECOM, we charging A? Watch it, there, okay?

[57 27 46] EECOM
I'm watching; it's fine.

[57 27 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 27 51] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[57 27 52] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 27 53 - 57 28 03] FLIGHT
Go one more time around that room. We're letting this thing go down, although I realize we don't have anymore thoughts to do, but I want to be sure that if there's anything we can do here, that we're doing it. To keep your -

[57 28 03 - 57 28 08] EECOM
Just power down, FLIGHT. All we can power down will put us in that much better configuration.

[57 28 08 - 57 28 12] FLIGHT
Okay, I got that part but are there any other things that you can do besides that, is what I'm getting at?

[57 28 13] EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

[57 28 14 - 57 28 19] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, can you help EECOM there as to what else you might power down, if anything? I don't know whether you can or not.

[57 28 20 - 57 28 26] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We'll work on that, although we're in an ATTITUDE HOLD situation here, and I'd hate to give up the CMC and the IMU right now.

[57 28 29 - 57 28 31] FLIGHT
Yeah, well the CMC doesn't matter.
> The SCS can perform an ATT HOLD without input from the CMC.

[57 28 35] GNC
Okay, we'll work on it, FLIGHT.

[57 28 35 - 57 28 38] EECOM
FLIGHT, we're not going to have anything in about 40 minutes here.

[57 28 50] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 28 56] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 28 58] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 28 59 - 57 29 04] EECOM
Okay, we've got an update on the time. Looks like we've got about 18 minutes until we get down to 100psi, and that's the cutoff point.

[57 29 05 - 57 29 07] FLIGHT
Alright. But we're charging BATTERY A.

[57 29 07 - 57 29 09] EECOM
Well, that doesn't mean much in 18 minutes, though. But we're doing all we can do.

[57 29 10 - 57 29 13] FLIGHT
Alright. CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time.

[57 29 14] GUIDO
Go ahead.

[57 29 15] CONTROL
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 29 15 -] FLIGHT
Will it do any good at all to - TELMU, FLIGHT -

[57 29 19] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[- 57 29 29] FLIGHT
- join in here. The question is, should we try to do a quick align with the CSM and do an alignment in the LM? Can we keep an alignment in the LM up until 79 hours? Can you keep that kind of power on?

[57 29 31] TELMU??
Standby.

[57 29 32 - 57 29 37] FLIGHT
The pilots are reporting it's difficult to do that alignment from scratch in the LM docked.

[57 29 40 - 57 29 42] FLIGHT
And we get a tradeoff here as to whether we can stand that kind of power.

[57 29 45] TELMU??
Standby 1, FLIGHT.

[57 29 47 - 57 29 48] FLIGHT
Alright. Pronto.

[57 29 57 - 57 30 13] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC. We'd save a little power if we turn all the jets off in QUAD C. We're pulsing those jets and we suspect that - we've closed the PROP ISOL VALVES in QUAD C so it's doing us no good right now, so we need to turn off all the jets in the quad.
> Even with the propellant feed lines closed, with the thruster still on power would still be spent powering the solenoids in an attempt to fire.

[57 30 14 -] FLIGHT
Oh, okay, RCS SELECT -

[57 30 15] GNC
Right.

[- 57 30 17] FLIGHT
RCS SELECT is ??? check.

[57 30 27 - 57 30 30] FLIGHT
EECOM? Any need to dump water?

[57 30 34 - 57 30 35] EECOM
Negative on that, FLIGHT.

[57 30 36 - 57 30 37] FLIGHT
No sweat there, {Jack}.
1> CAPCOM Jack Lousma, still on shift since before the accident.

[57 30 46] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 30 47] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 30 48 - 57 30 51] EECOM
They get the {POWER AMPL} off? I heard them talking about it a while ago. I don't know.
1> The high-gain antenna power amplifier.

[57 30 51] FLIGHT
No, they don't.

[57 30 53 - 57 30 56] EECOM
We can eliminate that central in the 85 foot gainway.

[57 30 57 -] INCO
That's not exactly true -

[57 30 59] EECOM
Okay.

[- 57 31 02] INCO
We're looking at it to see how far down we can go.

[57 31 02 - 57 31 05] EECOM
Alright. I believe GNC has got some things we can turn down here.

[57 31 06 - 57 31 11] FLIGHT
Yeah, he just - AUTO RCS in Quad Charlie can go off; we've got that Quad PROP ISOL'd. Which I didn't know, but.

[57 31 12] EECOM
Alright.

[57 31 13 - 57 31 15] FLIGHT
Quad Charlie AUTO RCS - GNC, FLIGHT.

[57 31 17] FLIGHT
GNC, FLIGHT.

[57 31 19] GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 31 20 - 57 31 23] FLIGHT
Confirm: Quad Charlie is PROP ISOL'd off, right?

[57 31 24 -] GNC
Well, we haven't confirmed that, FLIGHT, but it appears that that's the situation we're in. The shock of the O2 thing, it probably closed those valves -

[57 31 35] FLIGHT
Oh, you think -

[- 57 31 38] GNC
- and we haven't been able to open them because those are powered off of MAIN B.

[57 31 40] FLIGHT
Mm. Okay.

[57 31 41 - 57 31 42] GNC
But A appears to be working okay.

[57 31 43 - 57 31 50] FLIGHT
Okay. We think Quad Charlie's PROP ISOL'd off, Jack, so in that case we ought to turn off the AUTO RCS SELECT; that'll save a little power. Probably not much.

[57 31 54 - 57 31 55] CAPCOM
Yeah - you want AUTO RCS OFF on Charlie?

[57 31 56] FLIGHT
Uh huh.

[57 31 57 - 57 32 01] CAPCOM
How about antennas? How are we doing? Did I hear them give me some bad comm there?

[57 32 02 - 57 32 04] INCO
We're in pretty good shape right now, FLIGHT.

[57 32 04] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 32 05] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 32 06] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 32 07 - 57 32 16] FLIGHT
Let me try one more time. Is it possible that if we got power to MAIN B that we could get TANK 2 powered up and up the pressure?

[57 32 17 - 57 32 24] EECOM
We don't feel like that's a possibility, FLIGHT. We might just be able to get power to B but we don't feel like we'll be able to get anything out of TANK 2.

[57 32 24 - 57 32 26] FLIGHT
Okay, now why is that? Tell me why.

[57 32 27 - 57 32 32] EECOM
It's because the numbers we're looking at indicate that it's essentially {ambient}.
1> Pressure-wise.

[57 32 33] FLIGHT
Hold on. ???

[57 32 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 32 39 - 57 32 41] FLIGHT
GNC, watch we don't pick up any rates now, will you please?

[57 32 42] GNC
Okay, FLIGHT.

[57 32 52] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 32 54] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 32 54 - 57 32 56] FLIGHT
How long have we got now in the cell?

[57 32 56 - 57 32 58] EECOM
Last account we had 18 minutes, let me get an update.

[57 32 58 - 57 33 02] FLIGHT
Okay. TELMU, what have we got to do to power up to get some COMM on the LM?

[57 33 02 - 57 33 05] TELMU
Okay FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here that gets power up first on the LM.

[57 33 14 - 57 33 15] FLIGHT
Yeah. EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 33 16] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 33 17 - 57 33 19] FLIGHT
Yeah, that gets us power but what do you want up? Just the COMM?

[57 33 21 - 57 33 23] EECOM
We'll have to have an environment for the crew, the way this can be -

[57 33 23 - 57 33 30] FLIGHT
That's what I'm asking you, EECOM and TELMU. We've got to figure out how - we're just about out of CSM talkin'.

[57 33 30] TELMU
Okay.

[57 33 31 - 57 33 33] FLIGHT
What do you want them to power up in the LM?

[57 33 33] TELMU
Standby 1.

[57 33 35] - EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM -

[57 33 35] FLIGHT
Alright.

[- 57 33 38] EECOM
- ?? here that we'll have to live out at the LM.

[57 33 38] FLIGHT
I understand.

[57 33 41] EECOM
Okay.

[57 33 55 - 57 34 01] FLIGHT
We've got a power up procedure from TELMU but we've got to start thinking about what you want pow - configured in the ECS and the COMM.

[57 34 01] EECOM
Right.

[57 34 02 -] FLIGHT
That gets power in the LM, and then we'll get you some COMM and TM here.

[57 34 05] EECOM
Yup.

[- 57 34 12] FLIGHT
Do we need to send any power to the CSM? For the platform, or anything? {Or, can we even do that?}
1> Sending power back over to the CSM wasn't part of the original design consideration.

[57 34 13 - 57 34 14] EECOM
I'm not sure we can do that yet.

[57 34 14] FLIGHT
Can't do that.

[57 34 17 - 57 34 18] FLIGHT
That was a long time ago.

[57 34 18 - 57 34 20] CAPCOM
Okay. When do you want them to start working on this procedure?

[57 34 21 - 57 34 27] FLIGHT
Well, tell them they can start thinking about the power - going over and powering right now because they're going to have lights problem in a little while in the CSM.

[57 34 27 - 57 34 35] CAPCOM
Okay, I'll send it up. And they wanted to know if we wanted them to try to reset the PROPELLANT VALVES in the secondaries.

[57 34 36] GNC
Yeah, roger, FLIGHT.

[57 34 37] FLIGHT
GNC?

[57 34 38 - 57 34 41] GNC
That won't do any good because we lost MAIN B and those valves are powered off of B.

[57 34 40 - 57 34 43] FLIGHT
No - no, CAPCOM. It's off MAIN B.

[57 35 34] FLIGHT
EE - TELMU, FLIGHT.

[57 35 36] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 35 36 - 57 35 40] FLIGHT
Does this title - this PG&E (??) page - mean anything more than just power up the LM?

[57 35 40] TELMU
No. That's all.

[57 35 41] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 35 44] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 35 52] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 35 53] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 35 53 - 57 36 03] EECOM
We'd like to go ahead and power down the CSM all we can except leave that battery charger on. Of course, leave a little light because we're going to be there in 15 minutes anyway.

[57 36 03 - 57 36 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we're going to out of power in the CSM in 15 minutes in the fuel cells. We want them to start getting the tunnel clear and get ready and get over there and power up the LM as soon as they can, they ought to send somebody over there. EECOM, what ought they do to leave the cockpit?
> At this point, the CSM is clearly a lost cause. But in the 15 minutes of power left, the controllers and crew need to ensure that the spacecraft life support, illumination, communications, and navigation are all ready to go in the LM, or the crew will be flying blind in every possible way: unconscious, in the dark, with no support or instructions from the ground, and with no idea which way the spacecraft is pointing.

[57 36 16] EECOM
Say again?

[57 36 17 - 57 36 25] FLIGHT
EECOM, GNC. What ought we do to leave the CSM cockpit? We're going to lose power on the buses, now what do you want to switch off?

[57 36 27 - 57 36 28] EECOM
Power it down, FLIGHT. All of it.

[57 36 27 - 57 36 30] GNC
The CMC and the IMU, mainly, FLIGHT.

[57 38 24] FLIGHT
That's the problem.

[57 38 41] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 38 42] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 38 43 - 57 38 46] EECOM
Last ditch down on O2 tank 2 is turn the fans on.

[57 38 48 - 57 38 49] EECOM
That'll cost about 1 amp.

[57 38 49 - 57 38 50] FLIGHT
What are they off? MAIN A?

[57 38 52 - 57 38 53] EECOM
They're on AC.

[57 38 54 - 57 38 56] FLIGHT
Okay. Fans in tank 2 ON.

[57 38 57] EECOM
Fans, tank 2, ON.

[57 38 59] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[57 39 02 - 57 39 11] FLIGHT
Tell them to try the fans in tank 2. They're off the AC and last ditch stand we'll try the fans in tank 2. Turn the fans on in TANK 2, it only takes 1 amp.

[57 39 11] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 39 26 - 57 39 28] FLIGHT
TELMU, GUIDANCE, and CONTROL; FLIGHT.

[57 39 28] CONTROL
CONTROL, here.

[57 39 28] GUIDO??
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 39 29 - 57 39 31] FLIGHT
Do you know status of the CSM platform right now?

[57 39 33 - 57 39 37] GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. It's - good as far as we know.

[57 39 38 - 57 39 42] FLIGHT
No, no, no. Do you know its orientation? Do you know its orientation?

[57 39 42 - 57 39 43] GUIDO
It's PTC REFSMMAT.

[57 39 44 - 57 39 45] FLIGHT
Yeah. You know what you've got, and so okay.

[57 39 49] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[57 39 50] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 39 51 - 57 39 53] FLIGHT
Did he get it? Fans 2 on?

[57 39 53 - 57 39 54] EECOM
We can't tell, FLIGHT.

[57 39 55 - 57 39 56] FLIGHT
He got it, did he, Jack? Number 2 fans?

[57 39 57] CAPCOM (off loop)
He said he got it.

[57 39 58] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 39 59 - 57 40 12] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, CONTROL, and TELMU. The point is, should we, quick - if you guys can't run out the power steady, run out - align the - your IMU to the CSM while we study the problem? See what we got in the way of power?

[57 40 13 - 57 40 18] FLIGHT
Tom Stafford is concerned that they'll have a hell of a time getting the platform aligned in the LM with AOT.
> It was already known that sun glare could cause problems finding star positions with the vehicles docked. On top of that, debris would prove a huge issue once this procedure was actually attempted.

[57 40 19] GUIDO??
I agree, FLIGHT.

[57 40 20] CONTROL
I agree, too, FLIGHT.

[57 40 21 - 57 40 22] FLIGHT
Okay. What's should we tell them to do?

[57 40 24 - 57 40 27] CONTROL
It's going to take about 15, 20 minutes as I understand it to do that procedure, that right GUIDANCE?

[57 40 27] FLIGHT
Which procedure?

[57 40 28] GUIDO
The docked alignment -

[57 40 29] CONTROL
Docked align.

[57 40 30 - 57 40 31] CAPCOM
How about you give me an Activation page?

[57 40 31 -] FLIGHT
How about - a -

[57 40 32] GUIDO
Well, how long does it take to -

[- 57 40 36] FLIGHT
- how about a coarse align? At least you get - at least you start in -

[57 40 36 - 57 40 37] GUIDO
Okay, that's in the ballpark, FLIGHT; that's correct.

[57 40 38 - 57 40 45] FLIGHT
Okay, now. What do you - what do we do to get this done? EECOM, you got all my power in the LM with that procedure? What power have you got on the LM?
> It's possible FLIGHT meant to ring TELMU here.

[57 40 45] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[57 40 46] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 40 47 -] GUIDO
We ought to go ahead and go a P52 first in the CSM and get -

[57 40 49 -] FLIGHT
That's what I'm asking you -

[- 57 40 51] GUIDO
- a reference. Right -

[- 57 40 55] FLIGHT
- do you know? Well, do you have one now? We don't have much time! Do you have a good one now? As far as you know?

[57 40 56] GUIDO
A good alignment?

[57 40 57 - 57 40 59] FLIGHT
Yeah! That's what I'm asking! Do you have a good alignment?

[57 41 01] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[57 41 02 - 57 41 04] FLIGHT
I'm not worried about the tenths of a degree, either.

[57 41 05] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 41 05 - 57 41 06] GUIDO
Well, it ought to be that good, FLIGHT.

[57 41 06 -] FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. So we don't need to do a 52 -

[57 41 07] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[- 57 41 09] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 41 09 - 57 41 13] EECOM
Okay, we need to open up the surge tank. The manifold pressure is dropping.

[57 41 16 - 57 41 22] FLIGHT
Uh - okay. Would you rather power that from the LM - pump that up from the LM?

[57 41 22 - 57 41 26] EECOM
Well, we - we've got to get into the LM first, FLIGHT.

[57 41 27 - 57 41 30] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, get them going in the LM. We've got to get the oxygen on in the LM.

[57 41 36] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 41 44] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 41 45] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 41 46 -] TELMU
Okay, we have a procedure here. Probably the easiest thing is to refer them to Activation -

[57 41 52] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 41 52] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[- 57 41 54] TELMU
- 11 and Activation 12.

[57 41 55] FLIGHT
What will that do for us?

[57 41 56 - 57 41 57] TELMU
That gives them the COMM -

[57 41 57 -] FLIGHT
Okay, Activation 11 -

[57 42 00] TELMU
And 12.

[- 57 42 01] FLIGHT
- and 12. 

[57 42 03 - 57 42 04] TELMU
13, step 1.

[57 42 05 - 57 42 06] FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, Jack?

[57 42 06 - 57 42 08] TELMU
And cross out the VHF stuff.

[57 42 08 -] FLIGHT
Okay -

[57 42 09] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[- 57 42 10] FLIGHT
- does that give us ECS also?

[57 42 11 - 57 42 12] TELMU
That gives us glycol circulation.

[57 42 13 - 57 42 15] FLIGHT
Okay, how about ECS? Come on, I need some oxygen.

[57 42 16 - 57 42 17] EECOM
Disregard the surge tank request.

[57 42 17] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 42 18] FLIGHT
Give me some oxygen.

[57 42 19] TELMU
Negative.

[57 42 19 - 57 42 20] FLIGHT
Do I need some oxygen right now?

[57 42 21 - 57 42 26] TELMU
Roger - just go to Activation {step} 1.
1> TELMU probably did not mean to say "step" here.

[57 42 26 - 57 42 27] FLIGHT
And start there, huh?

[57 42 28] TELMU
Right.

[57 42 29] FLIGHT
And go how many steps? Activation -

[57 42 32 - 57 42 34] TELMU
Just 1. Step 3.

[57 42 36] FLIGHT
Uh.

[57 42 37 - 57 42 39] TELMU
Activation 1, step 3, FLIGHT.

[57 42 39] FLIGHT
Step 3?

[57 42 40] TELMU
Right.

[57 42 40 - 57 42 42] FLIGHT
And then what? Activation 11?

[57 42 43] TELMU
Activation 11 -

[57 42 44] FLIGHT
12?

[57 42 45 - 57 42 47] TELMU
12, 13 step 1.

[57 42 48 - 57 42 50] FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?

[57 42 51 - 57 42 55] CAPCOM
I've got Activation 1 step 3; Activation 11, 12, 13 step 1.

[57 42 55 - 57 42 59] TELMU
Roger, and FLIGHT, in Activation 11, omit step 1.
> This is the VHF cross-out.

[57 42 59] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 43 01 - 57 43 07] FLIGHT
Okay. That'll give them what, now; glycol flow, COMM, and some ECS? Is that right? That's what we want.

[57 43 08] TELMU
Roger.

[57 43 08 - 57 43 09] FLIGHT
Okay. That's what we want.

[57 43 26] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 43 26] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 43 27 - 57 43 31] TELMU
One other input: we also need the DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

[57 43 32] FLIGHT
Roger.

[57 43 55 - 57 43 59] FLIGHT
Do you want them to do Activation 1 down to step 3 - TELMU?

[57 44 00] TELMU
That's affirmative.

[57 44 01 - 57 44 02] FLIGHT
It's down to step 3.

[57 44 03 - 57 44 04] FLIGHT
Down to step 3.

[57 44 09] FLIGHT
That's 12 and 13.

[57 44 11 - 57 44 12] FLIGHT
And DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

[57 44 17] FLIGHT
Right.

[57 44 19 - 57 44 22] FLIGHT
TELMU, when do we do DEMAND REGs to CABIN? That's the end of those three steps?

[57 44 22 - 57 44 23] TELMU
At the end of the sequence.

[57 44 23 - 57 44 25] FLIGHT
At the end of the sequence, DEMAND REGs to CABIN, Jack.

[57 44 27 - 57 44 32] FLIGHT
And I - I'm still not satisfied he's got Activation 1 down to step 3.

[57 44 37 - 57 44 42] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. The voltage is going to begin to drop and we'll need to power down with it.

[57 44 42 - 57 44 45] FLIGHT
Okay. What do you want them to do? Turn everything off?

[57 44 45 - 57 44 49] EECOM
Leave the lights on, and - leave the lights on. As far as they need it.

[57 44 49 - 57 44 50] FLIGHT
And where do they power it from, the LM?

[57 44 51 - 57 44 57] EECOM
That'll be power from the CSM as long as we have anything. We will bring up BAT A when we get down about 25 volts or so.

[57 44 57] FLIGHT
Why?

[57 44 59 - 57 45 02] EECOM
Until they get into the LM and keep their lights up and whatever they have to have.

[57 45 03 - 57 45 07] GUIDO?
We don't want to store the IMU alignment in the CSM right now, so we've got to keep that up until you get the LM aligned, right?

[57 45 08 - 57 45 09] FLIGHT
Mm. Okay.

[57 45 11 - 57 45 13] EECOM
We'll do that by bringing BAT A on MAIN A.

[57 45 14 - 57 45 16] FLIGHT
Well, we've got to quickly do that or we're going to be losing it.

[57 45 16 - 57 45 17] EECOM
We've got 3 or 4 minutes, FLIGHT.
> FLIGHT appears to laugh at this line.

[57 45 18] FLIGHT
Yeah -

[57 45 19 - 57 45 23] GUIDO?
But the thing is, we want to pass to them - when he does see it go down. Or, start going down. To get BATTERY A On.

[57 45 24] FLIGHT
Is that -

[57 45 25] GUIDO
To watch it.

[57 45 25 - 57 45 29] FLIGHT
Now, you think we really want to spend that to keep the platform on? We're using the entry batteries, too.

[57 45 31 - 57 45 33] EECOM
But we'd take out a battery we won't get back.

[57 45 34] FLIGHT
That's right.

[57 45 36 - 57 45 41] FLIGHT
No. Down to step 3. Down to step 3. All the way down to step 3.

[57 45 49 - 57 45 59] FLIGHT
Yeah. Alright, okay. I just want to be sure we're sure we want to do that. And quick, get a coarse align. CONTROL and TELMU, will the steps I got give me a coarse align?

[57 46 01] FLIGHT
CONTROL and TELMU -

[57 46 02] TELMU
Negative, FLIGHT.

[57 46 03] CONTROL
Go ahead; CONTROL here.

[57 46 03 - 57 46 06] FLIGHT
Will those steps that we've passed so far get me a coarse align?

[57 46 07] TELMU
Negative, that just gets you -

[57 46 08] CONTROL
Standby.

[57 46 08 - 57 46 10] FLIGHT
What else I gotta do to get a coarse align?

[57 46 11] CONTROL
Standby, FLIGHT.

[57 46 12 - 57 46 17] EECOM
Can we get those read up to the crew to step the power down? Of course, they can power down everything, but here's a good start.

[57 46 17 - 57 46 19] FLIGHT?? (off loop)
?? the battery will drain as they power down?

[57 46 19] EECOM
Roger.

[57 46 20] FLIGHT?? (off loop)
Then it's just the IMU?

[57 46 21] EECOM
That's roger.

[57 46 22 - 57 46 27] FLIGHT
Okay, but we wanted to keep that up for a little while, I thought you just said, with the BATTERY A. To get a coarse align on the LM.

[57 46 28 - 57 46 29] EECOM
Well, maybe there's a bit of confusion here.

[57 46 30 - 57 46 34] FLIGHT
Yeah. You just gave - you don't want to turn the IMU off until we get a coarse align on the LM, right?

[57 46 35] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[57 46 35 - 57 46 37] GUIDO
That's affirm, FLIGHT. And we'll support a battery until you get that.

[57 46 37 - 57 46 43] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power on down the CSM only. We want to put BAT A on - about now? EECOM?

[57 46 44 - 57 46 46] EECOM
Negative, not yet, FLIGHT. We'll let you know.

[57 46 46 - 57 46 49] FLIGHT
We're going to put BATTERY A on - can you put it on while it's charging?

[57 46 49] EECOM2
No. We'll have to take the charge off.
> From here out, two EECOMs are active on the loop. EECOM2 is John Aaron.

[57 46 50] EECOM
Negative.

[57 46 52 - 57 46 53] CAPCOM
We want to take -

[57 46 54 - 57 46 56] EECOM
We'll have to power down the charger and put it on MAIN A.

[57 46 56] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 47 05 - 57 47 07] TELMU
The VHF is not required, FLIGHT.

[57 47 08] FLIGHT
No VHF.

[57 47 12] FLIGHT
Well.

[57 47 26] FLIGHT
TELMU and CONTROL.

[57 47 27] CONTROL
Go ahead.

[57 47 28 - 57 47 32] FLIGHT
Look, it's unclear enough to me that I'm going to try to get a coarse align in the LM. You know where we are, then, right, {Will}?
1> GUIDO Will Presley.

[57 47 33 - 57 47 35] FLIGHT
Alright. Now, what do I have to do to get it?

[57 47 35 - 57 47 37] CONTROL
Okay, I'm getting you that step right now, FLIGHT.

[57 47 37 - 57 47 38] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[57 47 39] CAPCOM
Go ahead.

[57 47 40 - 57 47 54] FLIGHT
When we get a little lower, we're going to have them pull BAT A off, and we'll get him to put it on MAIN BUS A. We are then going to try to hold up the IMU long enough to get a coarse align in the LM, and then we'll see whether we're going to keep that coarse align up or not, but for right now we're running the profiles and we'll have to determine that.

[57 47 55] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 47 55 - 57 47 57] FLIGHT
That's the course of action, let Jack know that much.

[57 47 58 - 57 48 03] CAPCOM
Okay. And he wants to know what he's going to see and what he should do when he sees it happen to fuel cell 2.

[57 48 04 - 57 48 08] FLIGHT
We're interested in keeping up the IMU and the lights, for him to see. That's all.

[57 48 10 - 57 48 13] FLIGHT
EECOM, GNC: everything else goes off? INCO?

[57 48 15] GNC
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[57 48 16] INCO
Good plan.

[57 48 16 - 57 48 17] FLIGHT
GNC? Anything else goes off?

[57 48 17] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

[57 48 19 - 57 48 20] EECOM
The only concern we have, FLIGHT, I just -

[57 48 22] FLIGHT
Yeah, go ahead.

[57 48 23 - 57 48 27] EECOM
- is the IMU heater power. And - for the CSM.

[57 48 28] FLIGHT
Well? What do you want?

[57 48 30 - 57 48 32] EECOM
Well, if you want to maintain the IMU for re-entry, we've got to have the heater power on.

[57 48 33] FLIGHT
How much is that?

[57 48 34 - 57 48 35] EECOM
Standby, we'll take a look.

[57 48 45 - 57 48 47] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM, we can take it off at any time.

[57 48 47] FLIGHT
Take it off now, Jack.

[57 48 49] FLIGHT
Take it off.

[57 48 53 - 57 48 55] CAPCOM
Okay, I need some LM IMU align procedures.

[57 48 56] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 48 58] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 48 58] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 48 59 - 57 49 00] EECOM
We need to go ahead and start that power down any time.

[57 49 02 - 57 49 04] FLIGHT
Okay, do you want me to put BATTERY A on yet?

[57 49 04] EECOM2
Negative, FLIGHT.

[57 49 04 - 57 49 05] EECOM
Negative, we'll give you a cue on that.

[57 49 06 - 57 49 08] FLIGHT
Okay. Where do you want me to tell them to start, Clint?

[57 49 09 - 57 49 11] EECOM
Keep your lights up and everything else has got to go.

[57 49 12 - 57 49 13] FLIGHT
Everything else except the IMU.

[57 49 13] EECOM2
That's affirm, FLIGHT.

[57 49 14] EECOM
Roger.

[57 49 14 - 57 49 16] FLIGHT
Okay. Say again?

[57 49 17] EECOM
That's affirm.

[57 49 17 - 57 49 19] FLIGHT
How about the COMM? We don't have COMM yet with the LM.

[57 49 20 - 57 49 22] INCO
As soon as you take that POWER AMPL off we're going to lose the {data}.
1> The downlinked telemetry feed.

[57 49 24 - 57 49 26] FLIGHT
Okay, well let's - yes, let's be clear what we're doing here.

[57 49 29] FLIGHT
We're discontinuing BATTERY A.

[57 49 32 - 57 49 35] FLIGHT
Okay, so far I've got the IMU and the POWER AMPL up. Anything else?

[57 49 40] INCO
That should do it, FLIGHT.

[57 49 42] FLIGHT
How about COMM?

[57 49 42 - 57 49 45] INCO
Leave the PCM up, too. Leave the COMM configuration alone.

[57 49 46 - 57 49 49] FLIGHT
Yeah, leave the COMM configuration alone, CAPCOM, until we get COMM at the LM.

[57 49 51] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 49 52] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 49 53 - 57 50 02] TELMU
Okay, we've got one more - we want to make sure his {SUIT FAN 1} is - our SUIT FAN is positioned to 1.
1> In both spacecraft, the suit fans were run open-circuit with the entire cabin to scrub the air when the astronauts were not wearing suits. This is the answer to the oxygen request from earlier.

[57 50 01] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[57 50 03 - 57 50 08] TELMU
And the - on panel 11 we want ECS SUIT FAN 1 breaker closed.
> As always, you can find all these controls on the [Lunar Module Control Panel diagram](#ref-panel-lm).

[57 50 08 - 57 50 09] FLIGHT
Okay, you want SUIT FAN number 1 on.

[57 50 10] TELMU
Yeah.

[57 50 10 - 57 50 11] FLIGHT
With the breaker. Go ahead, CONTROL.

[57 50 12 - 57 50 13] CONTROL
Okay, FLIGHT, here's what we need.

[57 50 13 - 57 50 25] FLIGHT
Alright, standby. CAPCOM, in the LM we need the SUIT FAN number 1 and its circuit breaker on to get flow, and CONTROL's coming to me with the IMU procedure. Go, CONTROL.

[57 50 26 - 57 50 29] CONTROL
Panel 11. LGC DSKY closed.

[57 50 30 - 57 50 31] FLIGHT
That's the circuit breaker?

[57 50 31] CONTROL
Yes.

[57 50 32 - 57 50 33] FLIGHT
Panel 11 closed; yup.

[57 50 34 - 57 50 38] CONTROL
Okay. Then go to Activation page 25, do steps 1, 2, and 3.

[57 50 39 - 57 50 41] FLIGHT
1, 2, and 3? And what will that get us?

[57 50 43 - 57 50 45] CONTROL
Okay, that'll get everything up and running and the platform turned on.

[57 50 46] FLIGHT
And will that get us a coarse align?

[57 50 47 - 57 50 48] CONTROL
Negative, that'll push him through. (??)

[57 50 48] FLIGHT
Okay, and then do -

[57 50 49 - 57 50 50] CONTROL
Go to Activation 37.

[57 50 51] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 50 51 - 57 50 53] CONTROL
The IMU coarse align procedure is there for you.

[57 50 54 - 57 50 55] FLIGHT
Okay. Got it, CAPCOM?

[57 50 55 - 57 50 58] CONTROL
Excuse me - 30. That's Activation 30, FLIGHT.

[57 50 58] FLIGHT
Okay.

[57 50 59 - 57 51 04] CAPCOM
Okay. I've got LGC/DSKY close, Activation 25 steps 1, 2, and 3, Activation 30.

[57 51 05 - 57 51 08] FLIGHT
Okay, TELMU, one more question. Are we bringing up glycol flow here?

[57 51 08 - 57 51 11] TELMU
We brought up circulation. We have not activated the boiler.

[57 51 11] FLIGHT
Should we?

[57 51 12 - 57 51 13] TELMU
I don't know; we're working on it, FLIGHT.

[57 51 13] FLIGHT
Alright.

[57 51 14] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 51 15] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 51 16 - 57 51 32] EECOM
Okay, when we go through this power down when we bring BAT A up, we want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure for fuel cell 2, just in case the pressure should recover and we would still have a fuel cell later. Which is not likely, but it's not going to cost us anything to do it except a little time.

[57 51 32 - 57 51 34] FLIGHT
Fuel cell 2 shutdown; that closes the reactants?

[57 51 35 - 57 51 37] EECOM
I'm - I'm sorry. Standby. Standby's the word.

[57 51 38] FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay.

[57 51 42 - 57 51 46] FLIGHT
Do you want me to put fuel cell number 2 on standby when? After we put BATTERY A on?

[57 51 47] EECOM
That's affirmative.

[57 51 48 - 57 51 49] FLIGHT
How close are we to doing that?

[57 51 50 - 57 51 51] EECOM
Well, we're looking for it any time now.

[57 51 52] FLIGHT
Eh.

[57 52 04 - 57 52 08] FLIGHT
Have we got anybody over in the LM yet, Jack? Can you tell? Somebody climbed over there? They're both over there?

[57 52 08 - 57 52 15] CAPCOM
Yeah, we've got them both over there, and they've just taken the procedure for the activation of the IMU.

[57 52 15 - 57 52 20] FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay. I don't know how long we'll be able to keep that up, but at least we'll have something.

[57 52 22 - 57 52 26] CAPCOM
Okay, and what other things you've got to go up that I missed while I was talking?

[57 52 39 - 57 52 41] CAPCOM
Have we given them the signal on the battery yet?

[57 52 44] FLIGHT
Uh, no.

[57 52 45] EECOM
Negative on that.

[57 52 46 - 57 52 47] EECOM2
About another 20 psi, FLIGHT.

[57 52 48 - 57 52 50] FLIGHT
GNC, FLIGHT. What do you want on the heater? Circuit breakers?

[57 52 51 - 57 52 58] GNC
We're still working on that, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it - find out if we can power them down and bring the platform up later on, whether we've really got a problem there or not.

[57 52 59 - 57 53 01] FLIGHT
Alright. Go ahead. We'll have BMAGs.

[57 53 02] GNC
Roger.

[57 53 19] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 53 20] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 53 21 - 57 53 23] EECOM
We can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off anytime.

[57 53 29] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 53 30] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 53 30 - 57 53 31] EECOM
BYPASS on the primary {rads}.
1> Radiators, which cooled the water/glycol coolant.

[57 53 32 - 57 53 33] EECOM2
Turn the GLYCOL PUMP off.

[57 53 34 - 57 53 37] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, he can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off in the CSM.

[57 53 38] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 53 39] EECOM2
BYPASS on the rads.

[57 53 40 - 57 53 42] FLIGHT
BYPASS on the rads, and then turn the pump off, huh?

[57 53 43] EECOM
Roger.

[57 53 43] EECOM2
In that order.

[57 53 43 - 57 53 45] FLIGHT
Okay. BYPASS, and then PUMP off.

[57 53 46] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 53 47] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 53 47 - 57 53 54] TELMU
Okay, we should be okay thermally in the LM vehicle until we get telemetry; we'll watch it until we tell you to turn on the boiler.

[57 53 57 - 57 54 00] FLIGHT
Okay, fair enough. You can look at TM before you tell me about the sublimators. Thank you.

[57 54 00] TELMU
Roger that.

[57 54 01 - 57 54 03] FLIGHT
BYPASS and the GLYCOL PUMP coming off.

[57 54 13 - 57 54 15] CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. Anything else I missed while I was talking to them there?

[57 54 16 - 57 54 26] FLIGHT
Uh, I don't know, Jack. I haven't been following everything you've said, you did tell them that we're going to be putting BATTERY A on to keep the IMU up. I don't know how much time we've got here; another 20psi was the last I heard.

[57 54 27 - 57 54 29] CAPCOM
Yeah, and I'm standing by for a mark on that.

[57 54 30 - 57 54 34] FLIGHT
Yeah. How much power have we got left on in the CSM, EECOM? We haven't got a lot on -

[57 54 35] EECOM
We've got about 40 amps.

[57 54 36 - 57 54 38] FLIGHT
Okay. What else can we take off right now?

[57 54 39 - 57 54 45] EECOM
We passed the list to CAPCOM while we had the IMU heaters - IMU on it. Everything on that list but the IMU.

[57 54 46 - 57 54 50] FLIGHT
Yeah. Got it, Jack? You want them to start powering that stuff down, right Clint?

[57 54 52] EECOM
Roger.

[57 54 53 - 57 54 55] FLIGHT
Okay, Jack. Everything but that IMU.

[57 55 13] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[57 55 13] FLIGHT
Go.

[57 55 14 - 57 55 15] EECOM
O2 TANK 2 FANS off.

[57 55 18] FLIGHT
You're giving up there, huh?

[57 55 19] EECOM
Giving up.

[57 55 19 - 57 55 20] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, O2 FANS 2 off.

[57 55 23] CAPCOM
Say again, please?

[57 55 24 - 57 55 27] FLIGHT
O2 TANK 2 FANS can go off. There's nothing happening there.

[57 55 28 - 57 55 30] EECOM
That's confirmed. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, FLIGHT. That's 1, 2, 3.

[57 55 31 - 57 55 32] FLIGHT
You want to shut 2 down, now?

[57 55 33] EECOM2
That's affirm.

[57 55 33 - 57 55 34] EECOM
Just the pumps. Just turn the pumps off.

[57 55 35 - 57 55 38] FLIGHT
Oh. Okay. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, CAPCOM. That may be a verify.

[57 55 39 -] CAPCOM
Okay, verify all FUEL CELL PUMPs off, and -

[57 55 41] FLIGHT
Fans off.

[- 57 55 43] CAPCOM
- fans off in O2 TANK 2.

[57 55 43] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[57 56 02 - 57 56 04] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO, we have the LM downlink coming in.
> Good news; the beginning of communications with the Lunar Module.

[57 56 10 - 57 56 12] CAPCOM
We don't want them fans and heaters in TANK 1, do we?

[57 56 14 - 57 56 16] FLIGHT
EECOM, you don't want anything on in TANK 1, do you? Or do you?

[57 56 17 - 57 56 18] EECOM
Roger, we want them all on.

[57 56 19 - 57 56 20] FLIGHT
Leave them all on in TANK 1, CAPCOM.

[57 56 20] EECOM
That's affirm.

[57 56 21] CAPCOM
OKay.

[57 56 27 - 57 56 31] FLIGHT
I'm still seeing 40 amps. What all have we got on there, EECOM? CMC? IMU?

[57 56 32] EECOM
Roger, FLIGHT.

[57 56 33] FLIGHT
And some COMM.

[57 56 34 - 57 56 35] EECOM
IMU and CMC still up right now.

[57 56 35 - 57 56 36] FLIGHT
And SUIT FAN.

[57 56 38] FLIGHT
Now, EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 56 39] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 56 40 - 57 56 44] FLIGHT
Look, I'm worried about shutting this thing down so that it's safe when we want to repower it from the entry batteries.

[57 56 45 - 57 56 48] EECOM
Roger. We don't - we're going to ask you to bring up BAT A whenever we see the voltage begin to drop off.

[57 56 49 - 57 56 52] FLIGHT
I understand that, I still want some kind of closeout configuration. Okay?

[57 56 52] EECOM
Fine with me.

[57 56 53 - 57 56 56] FLIGHT
GNC, same with you. And I haven't heard from you on the heaters yet, on the IMU.

[57 56 57 - 57 57 02] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. Preliminary look at it, looks like we can pull all the circuit breakers - power on the heaters. But we're still trying to get a handle on it.

[57 57 04 - 57 57 05] FLIGHT
We may well have no choice.

[57 57 05] GNC
That's a fact.

[57 57 07 - 57 57 08] FLIGHT
I don't know - how many amps do they take?

[57 57 09] GNC
10.

[57 57 10 - 57 57 11] FLIGHT
Aw! 10 amps!?

[57 57 12] GNC
Roger.

[57 57 13 - 57 57 16] FLIGHT
I got - I'm looking at a hundred and - I'm looking at - fif, sixt, 80 hours!

[57 57 16 - 57 57 17] GNC
Okay. Roger.

[57 57 17] FLIGHT
That's academic!
> Given the LM batteries stored a total of 296 amp-hours each, running the heaters at 10 amps for even 60 hours is a complete nonstarter, let alone through to CSM powerup.

[57 57 19] GNC
I understand.

[57 57 20 - 57 57 21] CAPCOM
And FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

[57 57 22] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 57 23 - 57 57 29] CAPCOM
I've got a procedure for COMM activation; 28 on the panel here. It came from somewhere, is this something you want to go up?

[57 57 30 - 57 57 31] FLIGHT
INCO, is that the COMM activa -

[57 57 31 - 57 57 41] INCO
Negative, FLIGHT, the COMM activation is the same as you've got over there, except we want to change to NORMAL VOICE when he gets squared away. I gave {him} some {steerable angles} in case we want to activate it. So I have it - and that's the procedure.
1> CAPCOM
2> Angles to point the steerable S-Band antenna at.

[57 57 41 - 57 57 42] FLIGHT
Can we go on the OMNI right now?

[57 57 43 - 57 57 45] INCO
Roger. As we come up on the {Goldstone} with the 210 we'll be alright.
1> The Goldstone MSFN site in Southen California.

[57 57 46 - 57 57 47] NETWORK
We have AOS with the 210 now, FLIGHT.
> For the last 10 seconds or so noise has been creeping into the audio. This is the link with the LM coming in. The cause of that noise will become a critical question and problem in the coming hours.

[57 57 48 - 57 57 50] FLIGHT
We'll stick with the OMNI, yeah, Jack. So don't do anything with that.

[57 57 51 - 57 57 52] NETWORK
FLIGHT, we have OMNI data on the LM right now.

[57 57 53 - 57 57 54] FLIGHT
We have AOS on the LM.

[57 57 56] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[57 57 56] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 57 57 - 57 58 02] GNC
We've got a better number on that heater power; it only draws about 0.8 amps. So we'd like to leave that up.

[57 58 04] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[57 58 05] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[57 58 06] CONTROL
?? looks good. 129.9.

[57 58 06 - 57 58 15] FLIGHT
Okay. 0.8 amps for the rest of the mission is going to cost me 64 amp-hours. GNC, FLIGHT.

[57 58 16] GNC
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 58 17 - 57 58 19] FLIGHT
This is going to cost me 64 amp-hours.

[57 58 22 - 57 58 28] FLIGHT
I can't afford that! Can't I bring it back up without them? Is that absolutely known?

[57 58 29 - 57 58 33] GNC
Yeah, I think we can, FLIGHT, but the platform's way off -

[57 58 33] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[57 58 34] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[57 58 35] EECOM2
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[57 58 35 - 57 58 46] FLIGHT
Turn around here a minute. He's talking about the IMU heater, it's going to cost me 0.8 amps on - 142 hours at landing, I'm 80 hours away. That's 64 amp-hours.

[57 58 47] EECOM
Forever?

[57 58 48 - 57 58 49] FLIGHT
Can you hack that out of the entry batteries?

[57 58 50] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[57 58 51 - 57 58 55] EECOM
We might hack it transferring power back from the LM to the CSM, but we can't hack it on the batteries.

[57 58 56 - 57 58 59] EECOM2
FLIGHT, EECOM. Since it's only 0.8 amps let's hack it for a little while here. Then we -

[57 58 59] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[57 59 00] FLIGHT
Go ahead, TELMU.

[57 59 00 - 57 59 12] TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT. It looks like they are still on low-volt taps. We need to get the Activation step 12 substep 3 and go to high taps on the LM batteries, 1 through 4.
> The LM batteries collectively supplied slightly too much voltage at first. The taps pulled some of that load to reduce the effective voltage in the rest of the system.

[57 59 13] FLIGHT
Got it, Jack?

[57 59 14 - 57 59 16] CAPCOM
You want the high taps on the batteries, 1 through 4?

[57 59 17 - 57 59 21] TELMU
Roger, that's Activation 12 step 3. Looks like they're still on low taps.

[58 00 00 - 58 00 02] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, did you get in there about the high taps?

[58 00 02 - 58 00 05] CAPCOM
I gave them that about the high taps and they're going through it -

[58 00 09 - 58 00 10] TELMU
FLIGHT, looks like we're going to high taps.

[58 00 10] FLIGHT
Alright.

[58 00 14] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[58 00 16] FLIGHT
Calling, FLIGHT.

[58 00 17 - 58 00 23] INCO
INCO. We'd like to get NORMAL voice on the LM on panel 12. Set the switch to VOICE.

[58 00 25] FLIGHT
It's coming at you now.

[58 00 26] INCO
Okay.

[58 00 27 - 58 00 31] FLIGHT
Okay. Everybody in the room, how about sitting down a minute, and just keeping it a little bit quiet?

[58 00 33] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 00 34] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 00 35 - 58 00 37] CONTROL
All our systems look real good on low bitrate.

[58 00 37] FLIGHT
Thank you.

[58 00 38 - 58 00 39] TELMU
FLIGHT, we look good. TELMU's good.

[58 00 39] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 00 40 - 58 00 41] TELMU
We need SUIT GAS diverted to CABIN.

[58 00 43 - 58 00 45] FLIGHT
SUIT GAS diverted to CABIN in the LM, CAPCOM.

[58 00 59 - 58 01 02] FLIGHT
Okay, they're doing the coarse align now. CONTROL, can you see your platform?

[58 01 03 - 58 01 04] CONTROL
Negative. We're on low bitrate.

[58 01 06] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[58 01 07 - 58 01 08] CONTROL
We don't have resolvers.

[58 01 09] FLIGHT
Say again?

[58 01 10] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[58 01 10] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 01 11 - 58 01 17] GUIDO
Okay, we want them to go all the way through to the final line, past the angles test so we can get a good alignment with the CSM because that CSM is continuing to move.

[58 01 18 - 58 01 19] FLIGHT
Which step do you want to get to?

[58 01 20 - 58 01 23] GUIDO
We want to go all the way through to step 7 in the LM Activation.

[58 01 24] CAPCOM
What page?

[58 01 25 - 58 01 26] GUIDO
31. On page 31.

[58 01 27 - 58 01 29] CAPCOM
Okay, step 7, page 31.

[58 01 29 - 58 01 30] FLIGHT
All the way through that, Jack. ??

[58 01 30] GUIDO
That's affirmative.

[58 01 44] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 01 45] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 01 45 - 58 01 49] EECOM
Okay, we expect to put the battery on any time now. We're still going to give you a cue on it.

[58 01 50] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 02 04] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[58 02 05] EECOM
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 02 06 - 58 02 11] FLIGHT
While they're working the problem, do you want me to leave BATTERY A on MAIN BUS A?

[58 02 13] EECOM
When we give you the cue, we'll put -

[58 02 14] FLIGHT
- IMU heater?

[58 02 17 - 58 02 18] FLIGHT
Is that what your plan is?

[58 02 18 - 58 02 21] EECOM
Until we get - until we get through to the LM, that's right.

[58 02 21 - 58 02 29] FLIGHT
Okay. Now, doesn't - GNC, I wanted to hear from both you guys whether you want to leave that on the whole time, but we can stand 0.8 for now on the ENTRY BAT.

[58 02 30 - 58 02 32] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT. We're - we feel like we'd probably be able to power it down.

[58 02 33] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 02 34] GNC
Preliminary look at it.

[58 02 35] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 02 36] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 02 37 - 58 02 42] CONTROL
We indicate he still has the LDG RDR HEATERS on; he can open those up if he desires - panel 11 row 3.

[58 02 42] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 02 44 - 58 02 45] FLIGHT
During the middle of the align.

[58 02 45] CONTROL
Roger.

[58 02 46 - 58 02 47] FLIGHT
But remind me again in a minute, CONTROL.

[58 02 47] CONTROL
Okay.

[58 03 23 - 58 03 25] CAPCOM
Are we still awaiting the mark on BAT A?

[58 03 26 - 58 03 28] FLIGHT
I don't know. EECOM, how far away from BAT A?

[58 03 28 - 58 03 31] EECOM
FLIGHT, any time now, but the voltage is still up. We'll cue you.

[58 03 30 - 58 03 34] FLIGHT
Okay, well, I'm afraid it'll go fast, aren't you?

[58 03 35 - 58 03 37] EECOM
Well, we - it'll go pretty fast when it gets there.

[58 03 38 - 58 03 41] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you primed Jack about BAT A, haven't you?

[58 03 42 - 58 03 48] CAPCOM
I told him we'd give him a mark on BAT A. He wanted to know what to watch for. He'll see the voltage drop but we'll give him the mark.

[58 03 48] EECOM2
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 03 49] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 03 50 - 58 03 52] EECOM2
O2 to N2 ∆P is dropping; let's turn BATTERY A on.

[58 03 52] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, BATTERY A on.

[58 03 58] FLIGHT
Tell him to hurry.

[58 04 00 - 58 04 01] FLIGHT
He got it. Good boy.

[58 04 09 - 58 04 10] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, copy the numbers.

[58 04 14 - 58 04 15] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, copy those numbers.

[58 04 16] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[58 04 34 - 58 04 37] FLIGHT
You got BATTERY A on there, EECOM? 11 amps.

[58 04 37 - 58 04 38] EECOM
That's affirmative, FLIGHT. It's on.

[58 04 50] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

[58 04 51] GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 04 51 - 58 04 57] FLIGHT
Let me know when they're all done and you've got what you want in the LM, because I want to get that CSM powered down.

[58 04 57 - 58 04 59] GUIDO
Okay. We can't watch the LM, FLIGHT, we don't have the high bitrate.

[58 04 58 - 58 04 59] FLIGHT
Okay, but from the voice.

[58 05 00] GUIDO
Okay. Roger.

[58 05 01] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[58 05 02] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 05 03 - 58 05 05] INCO
We can get high bit rate in the LM.

[58 05 06 - 58 05 07] FLIGHT
Does it cost me any power?

[58 05 08 - 58 05 15] INCO
No. We'd like for him to go to panel 12; we'd like to go FUNCTION switch to VOICE, and HIGH BIT RATE on PCM.

[58 05 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, got that?

[58 05 16] EECOM2
INCO, can you come meet me in number 1?

[58 05 17] CAPCOM
Say again, please?

[58 05 18 - 58 05 23] FLIGHT
They want to go to high bit rate in the LM. Won't cost us any power. And they can tell a little more.

[58 05 41 - 58 05 45] CAPCOM
And, FLIGHT, we checking his arithmetic? On the -

[58 05 46] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, arithmetic?

[58 05 48] GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 05 49] FLIGHT
How's the arithmetic?

[58 05 51 - 58 05 52] GUIDO
Standby, we'll check it.

[58 05 58] EECOM2
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 05 58] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 05 59 - 58 06 04] EECOM2
If we can get low bit rate with the POWER AMPL off, let's turn the PRIMARY POWER AMPL off on the COMM system. There's no sense in -

[58 06 04 - 58 06 05] FLIGHT
INCO? Can we do that?

[58 06 06 - 58 06 07] INCO
Yes. Let's try it.

[58 06 07 - 58 06 08] FLIGHT
CSM POWER AMPL off?

[58 06 09 - 58 06 10] INCO
LOW BIT RATE. DOWNVOICE BACKUP.

[58 06 11] FLIGHT
You need him to do that?

[58 06 12] INCO
Yes.

[58 06 13 - 58 06 19] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. LOW BIT RATE. DOWNVOICE BACKUP, and POWER AMPL OFF in the CSM.

[58 06 20] CAPCOM
Okay.

[58 06 21 - 58 06 22] EECOM2
INCO, EECOM. Meet me on number 1.

[58 06 26] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 06 27] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 06 28 - 58 06 29] TELMU
We need to get the SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.

[58 06 30] FLIGHT
Yes.

[58 06 39 - 58 06 41] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, LM: SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.

[58 06 49 - 58 06 50] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, how's that arithmetic?

[58 06 51] GUIDO
It looks good, FLIGHT.
> Not nearly the snappy slide rule action seen in the film.

[58 06 52 - 58 06 53] FLIGHT
The arithmetic is go?

[58 06 54] GUIDO
Roger.

[58 06 55 - 58 06 56] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, the arithmetic's good.

[58 06 58 - 58 06 59] FLIGHT
TELMU, we got an alignment now?

[58 07 00] GUIDO
A coarse align.

[58 07 01] TELMU
We've got a coarse align, FLIGHT.

[58 07 02] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM -

[58 07 10] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 07 30 - 58 07 43] FLIGHT
As soon as we've got the alignment and we're finished with it we're going CMC OFF, IMU OFF, we'll leave the heater circuit breakers on powered from - BATTERY A. Until you tell me whether we need to keep them up or not.

[58 07 44 - 58 07 46] CAPCOM
How come we're getting so much noise on the COMM?
> Again, an important question.

[58 07 47] FLIGHT
Don't know. INCO?

[58 07 50 - 58 07 54] INCO
We'd like to do a COMMAND RESET on the CSM so we can get the LOW BIT RATE.
> An answer to a completely different question.

[58 07 57 - 58 07 58] FLIGHT
I thought we just told them that.

[58 07 58 - 58 08 01] INCO
We did, but the way the commands work and everything -

[58 08 02 - 58 08 04] FLIGHT
Alright. They're in the middle of it, I'll give it to them in a minute.

[58 08 05] INCO
Alright.

[58 08 59 - 58 09 01] FLIGHT
Are we turning off some more of the instrumentation, gentlemen?

[58 09 02 - 58 09 05] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, have they got the fine align down to where you want it, yet?

[58 09 05 - 58 09 11] GUIDO
FLIGHT, we need him to read the angles to us. We've lost CSM data; we don't know what the CSM got on the {06 20}.
1> V06 N20

[58 09 13 - 58 09 14] FLIGHT
Okay, you really need that, huh?

[58 09 15] GUIDO
Roger.

[58 09 15 - 58 09 18] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, they need a VERB 06 NOUN 20 on the CSM. We lost it.

[58 09 26] FLIGHT
Here they are.
> Turns out, Jim is already on it.

[58 09 49] GUIDO
Copy, FLIGHT.

[58 09 50] FLIGHT
Yup.

[58 10 06 - 58 10 07] FLIGHT
You got everything you need, GUIDANCE?

[58 10 12] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 10 12] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 10 13] EECOM
We're ready to go ahead and power down the CMC now.

[58 10 15 - 58 10 17] FLIGHT
Wait a minute. I want to be sure the guidance is alright.

[58 10 17] EECOM
Okay.

[58 10 27 - 58 10 30] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, can one of you tell me if you've got everything you need?

[58 10 31 - 58 10 33] GUIDO2
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, we got everything.

[58 10 35] GUIDO
We're working on it now, FLIGHT.

[58 10 36 - 58 10 45] FLIGHT
Now - my question really is: when can I turn the CMC off? Are we that far enough inthe procedures that we can turn it off? Yes or no, that's all I'm -

[58 10 45 - 58 10 46] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We are, FLIGHT.

[58 10 47] FLIGHT
You are.

[58 10 47] GUIDO
Right.

[58 10 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 10 49] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[58 10 50] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 10 50 - 58 10 52] INCO
If you get us that COMMAND RESET we'll get some data; we're blind here.

[58 10 53 - 58 10 54] FLIGHT
Okay. Well - in the CSM, you mean?

[58 10 55] INCO
That's affirmative.

[58 10 55 - 58 10 57] FLIGHT
We're turning it down anyway, right now, Ed.

[58 10 59 - 58 11 05] FLIGHT
CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time. You've got everything you need through to fine align and we can proceed to power down the IMU in the CSM, correct?

[58 11 06] GUIDO
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[58 11 06] CONTROL
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[58 11 07 - 58 11 10] FLIGHT
Okay, and we'll leave the heaters on. Heater power circuit breaker on in the CSM.

[58 11 10 - 58 11 12] CONTROL
Check LM LDG RDR heater breaker also.

[58 11 13 - 58 11 32] FLIGHT
Yeah. CAPCOM, for the CSM. We've got the fine align data and everything is set up so therefore we can start powering down the CMC, the IMU. For now leave the heater circuit breaker on, and the BATTERY A on the bus like it is. We're running that IMU heater to ground to see whether we need to leave that on or not. And here's the - paper -

[58 11 32] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[58 11 33] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. 

[58 11 34 - 58 11 36] GNC
We got the go ahead to turn the heater power off.

[58 11 36] FLIGHT
Say again?

[58 11 37 - 58 11 38] GNC
IMU HEATER power to OFF.

[58 11 38 - 58 11 39] FLIGHT
And we'll still have it?

[58 11 40 - 58 11 43] GNC
That's right. We feel that we have a real good chance of bringing the platform up in good shape.

[58 11 43 - 58 11 46] FLIGHT
Now, do you want more time to debate it? I'm willing to give you 0.8 of an amp.

[58 11 47 - 58 11 50] GNC
I don't really know how much debate really needs to be done on that.

[58 11 51 - 58 11 56] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM. We need some data. We need to get the LOW BIT RATE - I think we need COMMAND RESET.

[58 11 57 - 58 12 05] FLIGHT
CS - CAPCOM, CSM COMMAND RESET, and then give them those instructions. We've got enough, we might as well save what we can on the battery now, and power down.

[58 12 05 - 58 12 07] CAPCOM
You want the CMC and IMU powered down?

[58 12 07] FLIGHT
Yup.

[58 12 08 - 58 12 11] CAPCOM
And heater circuit breaker - heaters off. Off on the -

[58 12 11 - 58 12 12] FLIGHT
And all the heaters, etc.

[58 12 13] EECOM
And COMMAND RESET.

[58 12 14 - 58 12 15] FLIGHT
And COMMAND RESET before they -

[58 12 16] CAPCOM
And you want BAT A, huh?

[58 12 17] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 13 04] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 13 05] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 13 05 - 58 13 16] TELMU
Okay, we've been watching glycol temps and I guess we'd better go ahead and crank up the water boiler. This is Activation 20 - - Activation -

[58 13 16] FLIGHT
Listen. Listen.

[58 13 18 - 58 13 19] TELMU
And Activation 21 step 3.

[58 13 36 - 58 13 38] FLIGHT
Do you want to leave BATTERY A on? EECOM? Is that still the story? For how long?

[58 13 39 - 58 13 40] EECOM
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[58 13 40 - 58 13 41] FLIGHT
How long will you want to do that?

[58 13 42 - 58 13 43] EECOM
Until we get squared away with the LM.

[58 13 43] EECOM2
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 13 43] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 13 44 - 58 13 48] EECOM2
All RCS AUTOs OFF, the 16 plus the 2 FDAIs OFF.
> Overlooked is that between turning the CMC, IMU, and RCS all off, the spacecraft loses all attitude maintenance as the LM systems are not yet fully activated.

[58 13 48 - 58 13 49] FLIGHT
Yeah. Got that, CAPCOM?

[58 13 51] ??
That'll be it, John. (??)

[58 13 52] FLIGHT
Alright.

[58 14 03 - 58 14 09] FLIGHT
Yeah. Before we turn his thrusters off in the CSM, CAPCOM, you'd better verify they've got some control in the LM.

[58 14 10] CONTROL
FLIGHT -

[58 14 10 - 58 14 14] FLIGHT
Plus, they need to bring up the water boiler. Go ahead, calling, FLIGHT.

[58 14 15 - 58 14 19] CONTROL
This is CONTROL. You mentioned them powering up the RCS; is that right?

[58 14 20] FLIGHT
Well -

[58 14 21 - 58 14 22] CONTROL
We're going to have to do that.

[58 14 23] FLIGHT
Yeah, okay.

[58 14 30 - 58 14 31] ???
CSM data - CSM data, FLIGHT

[58 14 38] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 14 38] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 14 39 - 58 14 40] EECOM
Heaters, fans, O2 TANK 1 off.

[58 14 42] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, all TANK 1 off.

[58 14 47] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 14 47] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 14 51] EECOM
Disregard, FLIGHT.

[58 14 52 - 58 14 53] FLIGHT
Yeah, have him go and get that stuff off.

[58 15 01] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 15 09 - 58 15 12] FLIGHT
AUTO - all the AUTO RCS and the heaters in TANK 1. 

[58 15 44] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 15 45] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 15 46 - 58 15 47] EECOM
They've got to get the power off when they can.

[58 15 48 - 58 15 49] FLIGHT
Yeah. Well, we just handed it to CAPCOM.

[58 16 05] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 16 06] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 16 06 - 58 16 09] TELMU
Okay, did you copy we need to crank up the glycol loop?

[58 16 10] FLIGHT
Yeah -

[58 16 10] TELMU
Activation 20.

[58 16 11] FLIGHT
Activation 20?

[58 16 13 - 58 16 18] TELMU
On the glycol loop activation. And Activation 21 step 3.

[58 16 20 - 58 16 21] FLIGHT
Down to step 3 or step 3 only?

[58 16 21 - 58 16 22] TELMU
No. Step 3 only.

[58 16 23 - 58 16 24] FLIGHT
Activation 20 and Activation 21 step 3 only.

[58 16 25] TELMU
That's affirmative.

[58 16 26] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 16 48] FLIGHT
20 amps.

[58 17 06 - 58 17 09] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT. For the LM, he needs to get his sublimator up -

[58 17 12] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 17 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 17 15 - 58 17 21] FLIGHT
Jack, the LM needs to get the sublimator up. Activation 20, and 21. For 21, step 3 only. Go ahead, EECOM.

[58 17 22 - 58 17 25] EECOM
You can go ahead and get those O2 TANK 1 heaters off soon. That's a {big chunk}.
1> Of the 20 amps still being drawn.

[58 17 25] FLIGHT
Yeah, O2 -

[58 17 28 - 58 17 29] CAPCOM
You want O2 TANK heaters off -

[58 17 30] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 17 32 - 58 17 35] CAPCOM
Okay. And Activation 20 and 21 step 3.

[58 17 35 - 58 17 36] FLIGHT
Yup. Get the sublimator up.

[58 17 39] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 17 39] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 17 40 - 58 17 44] CONTROL
We need to get our RCS heaters on. Start those warming up.

[58 17 44 - 58 17 50] GNC??
And get the RCS system pressurized, if we're going to be going out of CSM control here very shortly.

[58 17 51] FLIGHT
Yeah, we are.

[58 17 52 - 58 17 53] GNC??
That needs to be taken care of, first, first.

[58 17 55] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 18 01] TELMU
That's affirmative.

[58 18 25] FLIGHT
CAPCOM -

[58 18 26 - 58 18 27] EECOM
O2 TANK 1 heaters and fans.

[58 18 28] FLIGHT
Yeah. O2 TANK 1.

[58 18 33] FLIGHT
TANK 1.

[58 18 49] EECOM2
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 18 50 - 58 18 53] FLIGHT
Go ahead - that was to the - that was for the CSM, that FDAI.
> FLIGHT (incorrectly) thinks the crew misinterpreted the circuit breaker pull request as an instruction for the LM. In fact, the given abbreviated procedures never power up the LM FDAI in the first place.

[58 19 04 - 58 19 13] FLIGHT
And for the LM, CAPCOM, we need RCS heaters on, they need to pressurize the RCS to have control. And for the water sublimator, Activation 20 and 21 step 3.

[58 19 13 -] CAPCOM
Okay. I gave them 20 and 21 step 3 already -

[58 19 15] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 58 19 17] CAPCOM
- and you want RCS heaters on in -

[58 19 19 - 58 19 22] FLIGHT
Yeah, RCS pressurize - we didn't tell him to pull the FDAI in the LM.

[58 19 23] CAPCOM
No, that was the CSM.

[58 19 24 - 58 19 26] FLIGHT
Yeah. Does he understand that? Does that - Jim, does - has he -

[58 19 48 - 58 19 51] FLIGHT
CONTROL, do you want them to power the balls up and RCS?

[58 19 52 - 58 19 53] CONTROL
Definitely the RCS, FLIGHT.

[58 19 54 - 58 19 55] FLIGHT
Well, they need the ball to tell where they are.

[58 19 56] CONTROL
Roger.

[58 19 56 - 58 20 00] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, yeah, get a ball up in - one ball up and RCS heaters. And {press}.
1> Pressure.

[58 20 01 - 58 20 08] CONTROL
And they need to have all of the circuit breakers in for the ISOL VALVES and the main SOVs, FLIGHT. On panels 11 and 16.

[58 20 09] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 20 11 - 58 20 13] CAPCOM
Okay, in an orderly fashion, please. Ready. What you want, FLIGHT?

[58 20 15 - 58 20 18] FLIGHT
Okay, how's the CSM? Anything for the CSM?

[58 20 20] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[58 20 20] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 20 21 - 58 20 23] EECOM2
I think we're ready to power the main buses down. If everybody's ready.

[58 20 24 - 58 20 26] GUIDO?
They have no control in the LM, FLIGHT.

[58 20 26 - 58 20 31] FLIGHT
Let's be sure we have control in the LM. Although he's probably out of jets right now. GNC, you got anything for the CSM?

[58 20 32] GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

[58 20 33 - 58 20 43] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. For the LM, we think he ought to have an eight-ball, and we ought to get his RCS heaters on, his RCS pressurized, and he needs to get all his circuit breakers on 11 and 16 closed for control.

[58 20 44 - 58 20 52] CONTROL
Yeah, and Jack, what we're talking about is the QUAD HEATER breakers and MAIN SOVs, and ISOL VALVE breakers on panels 11 and 16.

[58 20 53 - 58 20 56] CAPCOM
Don't you have an Activation page I can just tell them to turn to?

[58 20 57 - 58 21 04] CONTROL
Yeah, if you want to close all those dadgum breakers. On that page. And then we can go back and open them all up later, the ones he doesn't need. That's Activation 22 and 23.

[58 21 22 - 58 21 23] FLIGHT
EECOM, GNC, copy his question?

[58 21 25] EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

[58 21 28 - 58 21 31] FLIGHT
Jack wants to know how we wanted to proceed with the SCS. Go ahead, John.

[58 21 45 - 58 21 48] FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT, you giving us something for getting your RCS up?

[58 21 48] CONTROL
Yes sir, FLIGHT.

[58 21 49] FLIGHT
Hurry up, will you please?

[58 21 50] CONTROL
Yeah.

[58 21 51 - 58 21 52] FLIGHT
We've just got a lot of traffic for the CAPCOM.

[58 21 52] CONTROL
Wilco.

[58 22 17 - 58 22 21] GNC
Okay, FLIGHT, GNC. The CMC and the IMU are completely powered down at this time.

[58 22 21] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 22 42] FLIGHT
Copy all that, CONTROL?

[58 22 43 - 58 22 46] CONTROL
FLIGHT, put the TCA breakers in last. The TCA breakers in last.

[58 22 48 - 58 22 50] FLIGHT
Okay. TCA breakers in last.

[58 23 07] FLIGHT
Yup. That works.

[58 23 08] CONTROL
Copy, FLIGHT.

[58 23 33 - 58 23 36] FLIGHT
Okay. CONTROL, do you understand the configuration we're getting into?

[58 23 37] CONTROL
Say again, FLIGHT?

[58 23 38 - 58 23 40] FLIGHT
Do you understand the configuration we're getting into?

[58 23 41 -] CONTROL
Right now, as I understand it, we're getting into a PGNCS ATTITUDE CONTROL mode -

[58 23 45] FLIGHT
Okay -

[- 58 23 46] CONTROL
- with an ATTITUDE HOLD.

[58 23 47 - 58 23 56] FLIGHT
Okay. My point is - let's be careful with what we're telling the CAPCOM to do here; try to give him as clear instructions as possible. Which is Activation pages as we can, okay? Now -

[58 23 57 -] CONTROL
Okay, but the circuit breakers -

[58 23 58] FLIGHT
I know.

[- 58 24 00] CONTROL
are all botched together on these charts, FLIGHT -

[58 24 00 - 58 24 06] FLIGHT
I know. Okay, you're ready to power down the inverters, the BATTERY RELAY BUS, and you're ready to pull the entry battery off.

[58 24 07 - 58 24 15] EECOM2
That's right. Now, that's not all completely configured to do it, but I think we've got to get off entry battery and then do it with voice, FLIGHT. Through the LM. COMM. Just got to kill COMM and everything.

[58 24 16 - 58 24 20] FLIGHT
Yeah. You're ready to do that. Is everybody ready to kill COMM in the CSM? GNC?

[58 24 21] GNC
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 24 22 - 58 24 23] FLIGHT
You ready to kill COMM in the CSM?

[58 24 23] GNC
Roger, FLIGHT.

[58 24 24 - 58 24 25] FLIGHT
GNC. GUIDANCE?

[58 24 27] GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 24 29 - 58 24 30] FLIGHT
We're going to turn down the CSM.

[58 24 31] GUIDO
Roger.

[58 24 36 - 58 24 42] FLIGHT
Yeah; I want to be sure we've got control somewhere. I'm not satisfied we do yet. Attitude control.

[58 24 49] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

[58 24 50] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 24 51 - 58 24 56] CAPCOM
Okay. We've got ourselves into a position here where we have no attitude control in either vehicle, have we?

[58 24 57 - 58 25 05] FLIGHT
I'm waiting to see when we get attitude control in the LM. Did they - would you ask them to call us when they have attitude control in the LM, and then we'll power the inverters, etc down in the CSM?

[58 25 07] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 25 08] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 25 08 - 58 25 13] CONTROL
Okay, once they get control established, we're going to do some setup work as far as loading the DAP to get his -

[58 25 12 - 58 25 13] FLIGHT
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

[58 25 15 - 58 25 16] FLIGHT
I just want to get attitude control first.

[58 25 17 - 58 25 20] CONTROL
Roger.  He's had to put his PGNCS MODE control switch to ATT HOLD.

[58 25 21] FLIGHT
Oh yeah. Okay.

[58 25 38] FLIGHT (off loop)
Say again?

[58 25 46 - 58 25 50] CAPCOM
Hey FLIGHT, they don't have attitude control in the - we don't have CM/SM -

[58 25 50 - 58 25 53] FLIGHT
Yeah. Okay. Well, they're trying to get it up, right?

[58 25 54] GUIDO
Yeah, they are.

[58 25 55 - 58 25 58] FLIGHT (off loop)
Okay. I just - what you want to know - pardon -

[58 26 15] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 26 16] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 26 16 - 58 26 21] CONTROL
We're getting pretty close into gimbal lock, as I understand it. We need to get that RCS pressurized and on the line -

[58 26 21 - 58 26 23] FLIGHT
Yeah, well, they're on the way of doing it.

[58 26 29] FLIGHT (off loop)
He didn't have a ball to do it with.

[58 26 31] CONTROL
He's got the DSKY, FLIGHT.

[58 26 35 - 58 26 36] FLIGHT
No - who he? CSM or the LM?

[58 26 37] GUIDO
The LM.

[58 26 40] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[58 26 41 - 58 26 46] FLIGHT
Go ahead - wait a minute, GNC. Yeah, we're having a control problem. What's the best way to get it; are you saying the LM, CAPCOM?

[58 26 49] FLIGHT
Alright.

[58 26 52] GUIDO
He can go DIRECT RCS, FLIGHT.

[58 26 53 - 58 26 56] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have him go DIRECT RCS and hold attitude in the CSM.

[58 27 37] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 27 38] FLIGHT
Can you wait a minute?

[58 27 40 - 58 27 41] TELMU
We're going to have to have AC here, for this.

[58 27 42] FLIGHT
For what?

[58 27 44] TELMU
For the balls.

[58 27 45] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, they need AC.

[58 28 00] TELMU
Both of them go in, FLIGHT.
> LOGIC POWER

[58 28 06] FLIGHT
Did you copy TELMU?

[58 28 07 - 58 28 09] TELMU
Roger, his LOGIC POWER breakers should be in. A and B.

[58 28 10] FLIGHT
A and B LOGIC should be in.

[58 28 40] CONTROL
RCS is pressurized.

[58 28 42] FLIGHT
Alright.

[58 28 46 - 58 28 50] TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here for the AC coming at you.

[58 28 59 - 58 29 07] FLIGHT
CAP - he needs AC for the eight-ball - CAPCOM. We need to get AC powered up in the LM. I'm sure they have a procedure, but there it is.

[58 29 20] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[58 29 21] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 29 22 - 58 29 23] FLIGHT
What's our current level in the LM?

[58 29 24] TELMU
41 amps.

[58 29 26] TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 29 30] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 29 31] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 29 32 - 58 29 34] TELMU
We show him still armed. We'd ask him to go MASTER ARM off.

[58 29 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 29 59 - 58 30 01] TELMU
Okay, we've got AC, FLIGHT. Looks good.

[58 30 03] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 30 15 - 58 30 17] TELMU
We see the pyros are disarmed now, FLIGHT.

[58 30 18] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 30 48 - 58 30 49] FLIGHT
TELMU - er, CONTROL?

[58 30 50 - 58 30 51] CONTROL
Go ahead. I copy.

[58 30 52] FLIGHT
Do you want to do that?

[58 30 53 - 58 30 56] CONTROL
The checkout? There's no need for it, FLIGHT. All we need to do is -

[58 30 57 - 58 30 59] CAPCOM
He wants to know if you want him to go down Activation 37.

[58 31 00] CONTROL
Negative.

[58 31 01 - 58 31 03] FLIGHT
Is he - has he got control now?

[58 31 04 - 58 31 06] CONTROL
Negative, he does not. I don't think he has his TCA breakers in yet.

[58 31 07 - 58 31 08] FLIGHT
Okay. But what do you want him to do?

[58 31 09 - 58 31 15] CONTROL
I want to get his TCA breakers in after he's got everything else configured, and then he can be in - he'll be in PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD.

[58 31 16] FLIGHT
Okay, there's no -

[58 31 17] CONTROL
5 degree deadband.

[58 31 31 - 58 31 33] FLIGHT
Anything needs to be done in the DAP?

[58 31 34 - 58 31 35] CONTROL
Yeah, we're going to have to load the DAP, FLIGHT.
> This trickle of piecemeal this-then-that is why FLIGHT indicated a preference for the prewritten procedures.

[58 31 36 - 58 31 42] FLIGHT
Well, do we want to be in PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD? Before we load it? Come on, now -

[58 31 43 - 58 31 46] CONTROL
We've got the TCAs in now, and everything looks real good right now, FLIGHT. We can load the DAP with no problem.

[58 31 46 - 58 31 48] FLIGHT
Okay, what numbers you want them to put to get it?

[58 31 48 - 58 31 52] CONTROL
DAP data load is for - this configuration is for 30120.

[58 31 54] FLIGHT
30120.

[58 31 55 - 58 32 00] CONTROL
Right. And we'll have to give you some weights; we don't have those yet.

[58 32 04] FLIGHT
Approximately.

[58 32 14 - 58 32 16] FLIGHT
Do we need a weight to go in there?

[58 32 20 - 58 32 21] CAPCOM
What do we have on weight?

[58 32 22 - 58 32 23] CONTROL
CSM weight: 63400.

[58 32 24] FLIGHT
63400.

[58 32 25] CONTROL
That's CSM weight.

[58 32 25] FLIGHT
CSM.

[58 32 45 - 58 32 47] CAPCOM
Okay, are we ready to go to PGNCS ATTITUDE HOLD now?

[58 32 47] FLIGHT
CONTROL?

[58 32 48] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 32 49 - 58 32 50] FLIGHT
You ready for PGNCS attitude control now?

[58 32 51 - 58 32 54] CONTROL
He's in P00 now, he - he's in ATTITUDE HOLD right now, FLIGHT.

[58 32 58] CAPCOM
How about it?

[58 32 58] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 33 05 - 58 33 07] FLIGHT
Tell - be sure he tells Jack that.

[58 33 32] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 33 33] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 33 33 - 58 33 36] CONTROL
Couldn't really copy - he may be having a problem firing his jets?

[58 33 37 - 58 33 38] FLIGHT
I don't know. I didn't hear.

[58 33 40] FLIGHT
He's asking if he's firing.

[58 33 42 - 58 33 44] CONTROL
Need to - make sure his ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker is in.

[58 33 48 - 58 33 50] CAPCOM
Okay, what other control circuit breakers do you want in?

[58 33 50 - 58 33 52] FLIGHT
If he's having trouble, check his ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker.

[58 33 53 - 58 33 57] CONTROL
ATCA (PGNS) breaker on panel 11, row 3.

[58 34 00] CAPCOM
ATCA (PGNS) and what else?

[58 34 01 - 58 34 04] CONTROL
And the ATTITUDE DIRECT control breaker - he's got that if he's got DIRECT right now.

[58 34 33 - 58 34 34] FLIGHT
Okay. That must have been what it was.

[58 34 35] CONTROL
That should have it.

[58 34 43 - 58 34 50] CAPCOM
Okay, can we check the switch configuration circuit breakers and the black boxes to make sure everything's configured correctly for attitude control?

[58 34 49 - 58 34 55] FLIGHT
Yeah. I'd like to be sure the LM is okay while we power the CSM down, now.

[58 35 01] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 35 01 - 58 35 02] CAPCOM
Okay - yeah, I heard him holler up the tunnel.

[58 35 02 - 58 35 03] FLIGHT
Yeah. CONTROL, are you okay?

[58 35 04 - 58 35 05] CONTROL
Yeah, we've got one TCP switch configured - (??)
> ????

[58 35 06 - 58 35 07] FLIGHT
Okay. But are you okay?

[58 35 08 - 58 35 13] CONTROL
Well, we look okay now, and we'll need another DSKY entry here very shortly to inhibit our upward-firing jets.

[58 35 13 - 58 35 14] FLIGHT
Alright. TELMU, are you okay?

[58 35 16 -] TELMU
Roger, FLIGHT, we're doing pretty good. I've got to get with you in a little while on -

[58 35 18] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 35 20] TELMU
- high {SNO2 pressure}.
1> ???

[58 35 21 - 58 35 23] FLIGHT
Yeah, okay. GUIDANCE, you okay in the LM?

[58 35 23] GUIDO
We're good, FLIGHT.

[58 35 25 - 58 35 27] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC and EECOM. We're going to power down. You ready?

[58 35 27] GNC
We're ready, FLIGHT.

[58 35 28] EECOM
EECOM. Go.

[58 35 37 - 58 35 40] CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. They've got attitude control in the LM now. What do you want to do with the CSM?

[58 35 41 - 58 35 44] FLIGHT
Okay, here it is, right behind you, Jack. For powering it down. There's the paper.

[58 36 11] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[58 36 12] EECOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 36 13 - 58 36 17] FLIGHT
Are there any switches you want in the off position before we power down? Like, for example, compressors or anything?

[58 36 18 - 58 36 19] EECOM2
No, FLIGHT. Let's just power - this down, we'll fix it later -

[58 36 19 - 58 36 20] FLIGHT
Okay. Okay.

[58 37 55] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[58 37 57] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 37 57 - 58 37 59] CAPCOM
You want them to open-circuit fuel cell 2, right?

[58 38 00 - 58 38 01] EECOM2
That's affirm, if he hasn't done it.

[58 38 02] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 38 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[58 38 17] CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 38 18 - 58 38 19] FLIGHT
We okay there with them? Right now?

[58 38 23] CAPCOM
Okay, open -

[58 38 29 - 58 38 30] EECOM2
Just close the REAC valves, FLIGHT.

[58 38 32 - 58 38 34] FLIGHT
Just close them. Just close the REACs.

[58 38 54] NETWORK
FLIGHT, NETWORK.

[58 38 55] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 38 55 - 58 38 57] NETWORK
We lost both CPs. We'll be up in a minute.

[58 38 58] FLIGHT
Hurry up.

[58 39 01 - 58 39 03] FLIGHT
We just lost data in the building, gentlemen. It's the CPs. Standby.

[58 39 10] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[58 39 12] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 39 12 - 58 39 18] FLIGHT
My problem, next, when I get around to it with you guys, is going to be what configuration to power down to.

[58 39 19] TELMU
Roger.

[58 39 20 - 58 39 23] FLIGHT
At the present time I'm thinking I'd like to keep the LM IMU up through {the burn} -
1> The PC+2 burn around the far side of the Moon.

[58 39 29 - 58 39 38] FLIGHT
- we're up on the CPs. But that's about as far as I've got it through. Everybody's running power profiles, and Jimmy ??'s people have those set of numbers right now.

[58 39 40 - 58 39 41] TELMU
Okay, FLIGHT, we'll work on it.

[58 40 01 - 58 40 02] FLIGHT
EECOM, are you all the way down yet?

[58 40 04 - 58 40 05] EECOM
Looks like the inverter went off, FLIGHT.

[58 40 06 - 58 40 07] FLIGHT
So he's in the process. Alright.

[58 40 21 - 58 40 22] FLIGHT
Copy, CAPCOM. Thank you.

[58 40 36 - 58 40 38] FLIGHT
Okay, look, gentlemen -

[58 40 43 - 58 40 46] FLIGHT
We - good LM data? EECOM? TELMU.

[58 40 47] TELMU
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[58 40 48] NETWORK??
- here it is.

[58 40 48 - 58 40 49] FLIGHT
Yeah, we have it.

[58 40 49] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO, we've got a problem.

[58 41 02 - 58 41 04] FLIGHT
We going to have good data here for a while?

[58 41 05 - 58 41 19] INCO
In and out, FLIGHT. We've got a different problem. By turning off the CSM, we end up without any good tracking data. There's no way we can get any tracking data. That LM data is biased because of the uplink shift, and data select cannot use that tracking data.
> Normally, the telemetry signal carries a base frequency whose doppler shift can be read to help track the spacecraft through a ranging system. But they had to shift that base frequency -

[58 41 21 - 58 41 25] INCO
Consequently, at some point here we're going to have to bring up some kind of tracking on the CSM again.

[58 41 26] FLIGHT
FDO, FLIGHT.

[58 41 27] FDO
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 41 28 - 58 41 32] FLIGHT
Would you figure that out? We're well clear now of the Moon, right?

[58 41 33 - 58 41 35] FDO
Roger that. As far as we can tell we are, FLIGHT.

[58 41 36 - 58 41 42] FLIGHT
And we need to - why can't we track this LM? ?? this LM interference - this IU interference -
> - because the radios on the LM and the IU on the S-IVB boost stage (also on its way to the Moon) operated on very similar frequencies, which caused interference. Normally, the LM would not be powered up until the S-IVB was out of range (in this case, it would have impacted the Moon) so this would not be a problem.

[58 41 42 - 58 41 47] INCO
That's right, because we had to bias off that frequency to change it down, making a bias in the data; that data's no good.
> Ultimately, this frequency shift allows communication but precludes that tracking methodology.

[58 41 48 - 58 41 50] FLIGHT
Is it possible to go back to the original and just leave this -

[58 41 51 - 58 41 53] INCO
We already tried it, FLIGHT. We tried it already. Doesn't work.
> If you want more background on this problem, [this Honeysuckle Creek article](https://honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_13_mission/hl_apollo13.html) starting about halfway down the page is an excellent, detailed account. The rest of it is worth reading as well, generally speaking. As well, [this article](https://honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_13_mission/a13_interviews.html#1) goes into some more of the technical specifics.

[58 41 54] FLIGHT
Okay, Ed. Thank you.

[58 41 58] FLIGHT
Mrrh. Okay.

[58 42 01 - 58 42 43] FLIGHT
Okay, everybody, look. We've got a number of long-range problems right now. We have the burn to do, which is at about 79 hours, 28 hours from now. And that's one business. We have to get the track up as we need it to take care of that burn. Hopefully we won't need to do too much with that, although I don't know how many amps that's going to take. However, right now, I want to be sure that we get the whole situation stabilized with the LM and the CSM. We've got to start bringing the LM power down some, and get any non-required stuff off the line so we don't use up any of these amp-hours that we don't need to give away. And I want you to pay attention to the configuration we're currently in and get the people offline working on the longer-range problems, especially the lifeboat problems now associated with the LM.

[58 42 46] FLIGHT
LiOH, etc.

[58 42 49 - 58 42 56] FLIGHT
Let's get all that configured. But right now I want the guys who are in the room to concentrate on keeping this thing right now going along all right, and watching it.

[58 42 59] FLIGHT
Alright.

[58 43 02] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

[58 43 02] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 43 03 - 58 43 05] CAPCOM
Okay, my gyro torquing angles still good?

[58 43 06 - 58 43 08] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, are those gyro torques still good?

[58 43 09] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[58 43 10] FLIGHT
And the crew wants those?

[58 43 11 - 58 43 13] GUIDO
Roger. We ought to go ahead and fine align the platform.

[58 43 14] FLIGHT
There you go, CAPCOM.

[58 43 15 - 58 43 23] CAPCOM
Okay, and on these - Fred asked the question, he'd like to pull some circuit breakers on displays and has us watch them; is he clear to do that?

[58 43 24 - 58 43 25] FLIGHT
CONTROL and TELMU.

[58 43 25] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 43 26 - 58 43 29] FLIGHT
Do you have good data there, and we can pull the display circuit breakers in the cockpit?

[58 43 31] CONTROL
Roger, FLIGHT. Just about ready.

[58 43 32 - 58 43 33] FLIGHT
Okay. Yes, gentlemen.

[58 43 33 - 58 43 44] CAPCOM
They want you to tell me what circuit breakers to pull, and I want them - defined as to panel and so forth, just like we did in the TCP, so there's no misunderstanding there. Okay?

[58 43 45] FLIGHT
CONTROL?

[58 43 46] CONTROL
Yeah, we copy.

[58 43 47] FLIGHT
Once you get them, TELMU.

[58 44 22 - 58 44 24] CONTROL
That's Activation 40, FLIGHT.

[58 44 24 - 58 44 25] FLIGHT
Activation 40, Jack.

[58 45 31 - 58 45 35] CAPCOM
Okay, FLIGHT. Do you want them to proceed with IMU fine align as outlined on page 40?

[58 45 36] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

[58 45 36 - 58 45 37] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. That's what we want them to do.

[58 45 38] FLIGHT
Affirm.

[58 45 52 - 58 45 54] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT. Did you up with those circuit breaker labels?

[58 45 55 - 58 45 56] TELMU
FLIGHT, we're working on them right now.

[58 45 57 - 58 45 59] FLIGHT
What do you mean? Don't you know what the circuit breaker numbers - names are?

[58 46 00 -] TELMU
Yeah, there's a whole slew of them -

[58 46 02] FLIGHT
Oh, okay.

[- 58 46 03] TELMU
- what we're going to do is just give you a page of them with -

[58 46 04] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 46 04 - 58 46 05] TELMU
- breakers: open circled.

[58 46 06 - 58 46 11] CAPCOM
Okay, I'm looking for panel - system - breaker name.

[58 46 11 -] FLIGHT
Yeah, they're going to give you a picture of the panel with -

[58 46 13 - 58 46 14] TELMU
We're just going to give you a picture -

[- 58 46 15] FLIGHT
- the circled - with the breakers circled.

[58 46 17] CAPCOM
Beautiful.

[58 46 19 - 58 46 21] CAPCOM
Do it just like TCP if you can.

[58 46 26] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[58 46 27] TELMU
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 46 27 - 58 46 32] FLIGHT
While you're doing that, have somebody else figuring out what we might take off here to save some current.

[58 46 33] TELMU
Okay.

[58 46 35 - 58 46 36] FLIGHT
CONTROL, same with you.

[58 46 37] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 46 38 - 58 46 40] FLIGHT
Same with you - we're going to want to save some power here, so -

[58 46 41] CONTROL
Right. We're working on it.

[58 46 42] FLIGHT
Figure out some suggestions.

[58 47 30 - 58 47 31] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[58 47 32] CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[58 47 33 - 58 47 39] FLIGHT
Jack, would you let me the conclusion of whatever discussions you guys had about - alignments? When you get - kind of one?

[58 47 39] CAPCOM
Yessir.

[58 47 40] FLIGHT
Thank you.

[58 47 42] FLIGHT (off loop)
Okay. I'll wait until you -

[58 49 22 - 58 49 23] RECOVERY
FLIGHT, RECOVERY. Did you call?

[58 49 24] FLIGHT
No.

[58 50 39] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[58 50 40] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 50 41 - 58 50 43] GUIDO
Okay, we'd like to have a (??) up for the LM, FLIGHT.

[58 50 44] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 50 45 - 58 50 46] GUIDO
Yeah, we're ready for it at the site.

[58 50 47 - 58 50 48] FLIGHT
Okay. We'll let - give them a little while, here.

[58 50 49] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[58 50 50] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 50 51 - 58 50 53] TELMU
Okay, we're tracking a little problem here on ASCENT O2 TANK 2 -

[58 50 53 - 58 50 55] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, remind of that in a little bit.

[58 50 55] GUIDO
Yessir.

[58 50 56] FLIGHT
TANK 2, what is -

[58 50 57 - 58 51 03] TELMU
The pressure is up higher than it should be, what we need to do is open ASCENT -

[58 51 04 - 58 51 06] FLIGHT
Before you go through the valves, what are you trying to accomplish?

[58 51 07 - 58 51 11] TELMU
We're trying to use the ASCENT TANK 2 pressure instead of the descent tank.

[58 51 12] FLIGHT
Is it close to venting?
> Most of the tanks had a rupture disc that would blow out at a high pressure, in a way that would be more controlled than the tank bursting entirely.

[58 51 14 - 58 51 16] TELMU
No, it doesn't - it's not venting, yeah.

[58 51 18] FLIGHT
Is it close to venting?

[58 51 20 - 58 51 21] TELMU
It can't vent. Unless it's broken.

[58 51 22] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 51 22 - 58 51 37] TELMU
And it's not broken. What we're trying to do is relieve the pressure in that tank, so we want to close the DESCENT O2 TANK VALVE and open ASCENT O2 TANK 2.

[58 51 38 - 58 51 39] FLIGHT
O2, tank 2 - how high is it?

[58 51 40 - 58 51 41] TELMU
It's up to {901}.
1> psi.

[58 51 42] FLIGHT
What's it at normally?

[58 51 43 - 58 51 44] TELMU
Around 830.

[58 51 45 -] FLIGHT
And you just want to use some of that and then we'll go back -

[58 51 47] TELMU
That's right.

[- 58 51 48] FLIGHT
- to normal configuration, huh?

[58 51 54 - 58 51 56] FLIGHT
Okay. Got that, Jack?

[58 51 59] CAPCOM
Okay -

[58 52 00 - 58 52 03] FLIGHT
TANK 2 looks a little high, so they want to use some of it.

[58 52 03 - 58 52 04] CAPCOM
Okay. I got that.

[58 52 04 - 58 52 05] FLIGHT
ASCENT TANK 2 -

[58 52 05 - 58 52 07] CAPCOM
Close the DESCENT O2 and open ASCENT -

[58 52 08] FLIGHT
O2 tank number 2.

[58 52 09] CAPCOM
Number 2; right.

[58 52 30] FLIGHT
TELMU, FLIGHT.

[58 52 32] TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 52 32 - 58 52 34] FLIGHT
Is it a good idea to close the DESCENT O2 VALVE now?

[58 52 35] TELMU
Yeah, it's okay.

[58 52 41 - 58 52 42] TELMU
He had to go that way, FLIGHT.

[58 52 43 - 58 52 46] FLIGHT
Yeah, I know that, but I'm worried about it coming back open.

[58 52 58] FLIGHT
Did we copy?

[58 53 06] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 53 06] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 53 07 - 58 53 20] CONTROL
FAO pointed out here - we are drifting around here on his middle gimbal angle - he's in MIN IMPULSE right now, and I'm assuming that's where he wants to be, but if he doesn't watch it close he can get himself into gimbal lock again real easy.

[58 53 23 - 58 53 26] CONTROL
He's not in an automatic ATTITUDE HOLD mode right now, he's in a drifting flight mode.

[58 53 28 - 58 53 30] FLIGHT
Yeah. He may be looking for stars -

[58 53 30 - 58 53 37] CONTROL
Okay, but it might be worth a confirmation - okay, he knows that he's in there because he's hitting the ACA right now. Okay.

[58 53 38 - 58 53 39] FLIGHT
Okay. How's he doing on the middle gimbal?

[58 53 41 - 58 53 43] FLIGHT
Okay. Alright. Is he away from it?

[58 53 44] CONTROL
Yes.

[58 53 45 - 58 53 46] FLIGHT
Okay. Well, keep your eye on it, Alan. That's good.

[58 53 46] CONTROL
Okay.

[58 53 48 - 58 53 50] FLIGHT
Just sing out if you think he's getting close and we'll pass it up.

[58 53 50] CONTROL
Roger.

[58 53 56] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[58 53 57] FLIGHT
Go.

[58 53 58 - 58 53 59] CONTROL
If you get a minute, I've got one little item here.

[58 54 00 - 58 54 04] FLIGHT
Okay. How many amps are we taking out there - standby.

[58 54 26] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 56 03 - 58 56 04] FLIGHT
CONTROL, did you have something for me?

[58 56 05 - 58 56 36] CONTROL
Yes, sir. When we pressurized the RCS here, we noticed we got some - about 5 psi of change in the ASCENT OX and FUEL tank pressures - an increase, okay? We noticed that shortly thereafter. And what we'd like to do is to make sure they've got the ASCENT FEED VALVEs actually seated in the closed position. And when they get time, it'll - close two circuit breakers and cycle the switches for us to the closed position to make sure they are closed.

[58 56 36 - 58 56 37] FLIGHT
Would you write down the procedure?

[58 56 37] CONTROL
Roger.

[58 56 38] FLIGHT
Bring it over, please.

[58 56 38] CONTROL
Okay.

[58 56 42 - 58 56 45] FLIGHT
They're talking about display circuit breakers right now. We'll let that get settled.

[58 56 46 - 58 56 58] CAPCOM
They're having to go up and look up some data books, but how about stowage-wise, FLIGHT? Do we have to worry about passing some gear back and forth? Maybe FAO ought to think about that.

[58 56 59 - 58 57 01] FLIGHT
Bob? FAO? You got people working on that?

[58 57 02 - 58 57 03] FAO
Say again, FLIGHT. Working on what?

[58 57 05 - 58 57 09] FLIGHT
Stowage - what might want to get passed to the LM? Or from the LM to the CSM?

[58 57 10] FAO
We'll have it.

[58 57 57] FAO
FLIGHT, I've got -

[58 58 12] CAPCOM
FLIGHT, CAPCOM.

[58 58 13] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[58 58 14 - 58 58 24] CAPCOM
Okay, I have this abort PAD, and I've got some gimbal trim angles. Pitch and roll are - are these the ones that were preset, or are we going to have to jimmy these around?

[58 58 25 - 58 58 28] FLIGHT
The preset ones probably were from docked. But let me check. RETRO?

[58 58 33] FLIGHT
RETRO?

[58 58 35] FLIGHT
FLIGHT.

[58 58 36] RETRO
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[58 58 38 - 58 58 42] FLIGHT
These LM DPS trims, are they different than the ones in the vehicle right now?

[58 58 42 -] RETRO
That's affirm. This is based on -

[58 58 44] FLIGHT
Docked burn?

[- 58 58 45] RETRO
Docked burn.

[58 58 46 - 58 58 47] FLIGHT
And the ones they have on board are undocked, right?

[58 58 48] RETRO
That's affirm. For PDI.

[58 58 49] FLIGHT
Okay.

[58 58 50 - 58 58 51] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL. We've got some updates on those trims.

[58 58 52 - 58 58 55] FLIGHT
Oh. Okay. Well, come on in with them.

[58 58 56 - 58 58 57] CONTROL
Okay, I can give them to you right now.

[58 58 58 - 58 59 08] CAPCOM
This is a coordination problem on these gimbal angles - I guess we're going to have to think of a procedure to coordinate the setting of those angles.

[58 59 08] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[58 59 10 -] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you talking to me? I don't know what you mean -

[58 59 12] CAPCOM
Affirm.

[- 58 59 13] FLIGHT
- which gimbal angles?

[58 59 14 - 58 59 15] CAPCOM
The DPS trim angles.

[58 59 15] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[58 59 16 - 58 59 25] CAPCOM
Okay, they can't - they can't read them out on board - set them on board. They have to run them and then have us verify down on the ground. Right?

[58 59 27 - 58 59 30] FLIGHT
Yeah, well we can watch them trim it. I'm not sure I know what you're asking me, Jack.

[58 59 31 - 58 59 36] CAPCOM
We're going to have to, say - tweak it a little more and then we're going to have to, say -

[58 59 37 - 58 59 39] FLIGHT
No. They can trim it automatically, then load it. And run it through the program.

[58 59 40 - 58 59 42] CAPCOM
But we have to verify because there's a different time that -

[58 59 42 - 58 59 43] FLIGHT
Oh yeah. Yeah, we can verify the number.

[58 59 44] CAPCOM
Okay.

[58 59 45 - 58 59 47] FLIGHT
And we're getting some new ones, so hold up on those - GUIDANCE, you calling me?

[58 59 48 - 58 59 49] GUIDO
Roger. The middle gimbal angle's getting big, FLIGHT.

[58 59 51] FLIGHT
Getting close?
> To gimbal lock.

[58 59 52] GUIDO
About 60 degrees.

[58 59 53 - 58 59 54] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, have him watch his gimbal angle.

[58 59 56 - 58 59 58] CAPCOM
Okay, I think I hear him doing that. What do you want him to do, just -

[58 59 59 - 59 00 00] FLIGHT
Well, in case he hadn't noticed, it's getting close.

[59 01 21 - 59 01 22] FLIGHT
Could I get the people in the room to be quiet?

[59 01 24 - 59 01 25] FLIGHT
CAPCOM's talking.

[59 01 34 - 59 01 37] FLIGHT
CAPCOM - standby, CAPCOM. Hey TELMU, he's talking.

[59 01 39 - 59 01 40] CAPCOM
We have any on panel 16?

[59 02 55] FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT.

[59 02 57] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[59 02 58 - 59 03 00] FLIGHT
Hope you've got somebody working on a PTC procedure.

[59 03 00 - 59 03 03] CONTROL
Right. We've already got one worked out, but it's an AGS-type procedure, FLIGHT.

[59 03 03] FLIGHT
That's okay.

[59 03 07 - 59 03 09] FLIGHT
I see - yeah, we don't have the trim angle yet, but okay.

[59 03 13] CAPCOM
Got some angles?

[59 03 15] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[59 03 16] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 03 17 - 59 03 24] TELMU
The CAPCOM read up the circuit breakers to open on panel 11; I don't believe he turned the page over. There's some more of them. Panel 16 also.

[59 03 25 - 59 03 33] FLIGHT
Just a minute, TELMU. RETRO and CONTROL, FLIGHT. The COAS angle you have N/A, are they not - fine align available?

[59 03 34] FLIGHT
RETRO, FLIGHT.

[59 03 36] RETRO
Go, FLIGHT.

[59 03 36 - 59 03 38] FLIGHT
What does this N/A mean? For the COAS?

[59 03 40 - 59 03 41] RETRO
FDO said it was not available.

[59 03 44 - 59 03 45] FLIGHT
What do you mean, not available?

[59 03 45 - 59 03 49] RETRO
Not - not applicable. He said not available.

[59 03 51 - 59 03 54] RETRO
You'll have to talk with GUIDO if you want more verification on that.

[59 03 55] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE?

[59 04 00] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

[59 04 01] GUIDO
Go, FLIGHT.

[59 04 02 - 59 04 06] FLIGHT
Don't you want to add a COAS star to this PC+2? The CAPCOM asked why not.

[59 04 13 - 59 04 16] GUIDO
FLIGHT, we have to know which axis that thing's mounted along for that to happen.

[59 04 17 - 59 04 20] FLIGHT
Okay. You don't have enough data to figure that out, is that right, right now?

[59 04 21 - 59 04 23] GUIDO
Well, I don't know if he's got it mounted along the Z-axis or the X-axis, FLIGHT.

[59 04 24 - 59 04 25] FLIGHT
Okay. That's what I said. Okay.

[59 04 34 - 59 04 38] FLIGHT
TELMU, write down what you want us to do, please, on the circuit breaker - I didn't hear you last time.

[59 04 39 - 59 04 48] TELMU
The CAPCOM only read one side of that circuit breaker - we gave him a sheet, there's circuit breakers on panel 11 and 16 to open.

[59 04 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 04 49] TELMU
He only read up one side.

[59 04 50] FLIGHT
He only read up panel 11?

[59 04 51] TELMU
Yes.

[59 04 52] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 04 53] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[59 04 54] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 04 54 - 59 05 00] GUIDO
We can go ahead and compute one for along the Z-axis and if it's not mounted here he can move it and mount the COAS over on the Z-axis.

[59 05 01] FLIGHT
Okay. Go ahead.

[59 05 54 - 59 05 57] FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. Do you copy what happened? ???

[59 05 59 - 59 06 01] FLIGHT
Do we see any venting in the LM?

[59 06 03 - 59 06 06] CONTROL
Negative. We've got a lot of drops in and out of data.

[59 06 08 - 59 06 10] FLIGHT
Okay. He's having some difficulty with it. Let's look for reasons why.

[59 06 11] CONTROL
Roger.

[59 06 31 - 59 06 34] FLIGHT
It's 133 hours. To AOL, to the Atlantic.
> In the end, it would be closer to 143 hours.

[59 06 35 - 59 06 37] FLIGHT
You might let them know we're talking about that, too, Jack.

[59 07 33] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.

[59 07 34 - 59 07 37] GUIDO
We have a load, FLIGHT, but INCO says we can't COMMAND.

[59 07 38 - 59 07 39] FLIGHT
Why not? INCO?

[59 07 40 - 59 07 41] INCO
We can COMMAND if we go to LOW BITRATE.

[59 07 42 - 59 07 44] FLIGHT
Let's give them the numbers, and they'll punch them in.

[59 07 45] INCO
Sorry?

[59 07 46 - 59 07 47] FLIGHT
At least give them the numbers to punch in.

[59 07 47 - 59 07 48] GUIDO
We'll read it up to him, FLIGHT.

[59 07 49] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[59 08 39] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[59 08 40] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 08 41 - 59 08 43] CONTROL
Okay, I've got this list of stuff here for the ascent feed.

[59 08 44 - 59 08 45] FLIGHT
Okay. Bring it over. Have somebody hand it on.

[59 08 52 - 59 08 56] CAPCOM
And FLIGHT, did we come up with something with regards to his - uplinking a time?

[59 08 57 - 59 09 02] FLIGHT
We're having trouble uplinking the time. We'd have to go to LOW BITRATE - can he easily punch it in the DSKY there, GUIDANCE?

[59 09 03] PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

[59 09 04] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 09 05 -] PROCEDURES
Okay, stand by on that. We're trying an uplink mode that might give us COMMAND -

[59 09 07] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 59 09 08] PROCEDURES
- and VOICE and HIGH BITRATE.

[59 09 09] FLIGHT
Alright.

[59 09 10] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[59 09 11] CAPCOM
Go.

[59 09 12 - 59 09 20] FLIGHT
For your information, the problem is that we've deviate some of the frequencies because of the proximity of the IU frequency, and that thing's still alive. Copy?

[59 09 21] CAPCOM
Okay.

[59 09 22 - 59 09 24] FLIGHT
And that's - so it's a little bit nonstandard in that regard.

[59 09 26] CAPCOM
Okay.

[59 09 26 - 59 09 32] FLIGHT
But they're seeing what they can do. Why don't you give them a GET hack, though, eh? And let them know we're reading that VOX.

[59 09 41] PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

[59 09 42] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 09 42 - 59 09 45] PROCEDURES
Roger. We're on a COMMAND UPLINK mode along with VOICE, and we've got HIGH BITRATE data.

[59 09 46 - 59 09 50] FLIGHT
Okay. Pull in data and we can give him a time - wait a minute. GUIDANCE, you ready to give them a time?

[59 09 50 - 59 09 51] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We've got the load.

[59 09 52] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 09 55 - 59 09 56] FLIGHT
We're ready to go, Jack.

[59 10 00] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[59 10 01] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 10 02 - 59 10 04] INCO
He's got his UPDATA LINK OFF.

[59 10 16] FLIGHT
CAPCOM.

[59 10 24 - 59 10 26] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE. We've got the load to go ahead and do it now.

[59 10 27] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[59 10 28 - 59 10 29] FLIGHT
Yeah, I know. We've got another problem. Go ahead, INCO.

[59 10 30 - 59 10 32] INCO
I think it would be better if we go to FORWARD OMNI on the LM now. This uplink.

[59 10 43] FLIGHT
You want FORWARD OMNI?

[59 10 44] INCO
Roger.

[59 10 49] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[59 10 52] INCO
Hurry.

[59 10 55 - 59 10 58] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, you need to - going to need to get FORWARD OMNI in the LM.

[59 11 00 - 59 11 01] INCO
I believe he's already done it, FLIGHT.

[59 11 02 - 59 11 04] FLIGHT
Okay. Oh, it's already done. Hm. Okay.

[59 11 05 - 59 11 10] CAPCOM
Okay, and he's going to write a mission time into the LGC.

[59 11 15 - 59 11 16] FLIGHT
Can you do this when you don't have a DSKY? Time?

[59 11 28 - 59 11 30] FLIGHT
That'll give him his clock, will it, RETRO?

[59 11 32] RETRO
That's affirmative.

[59 11 32] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 11 33] CONTROL
FLIGHT, CONTROL.

[59 11 34] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 11 35 - 59 11 40] CONTROL
Okay, if he wants to turn his inverters off, we can monitor his middle gimbal angle here for him. One other suggestion I have is that he -

[59 11 41 - 59 11 43] FLIGHT
Wait, wait a minute. Let me - let me hear the COMM, here.

[59 12 44 - 59 12 46] RETRO
FLIGHT, RETRO. We've got a good clock update.

[59 12 47] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 12 54] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[59 12 55] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 12 55 - 59 13 09] INCO
We've got a chance here, we'd like to take and change our offset on the two vehicles, on how we're getting telemetry, to try to solve this tracking problem. To do that we're going to have to drop the LM uplink and break lock for maybe 5 to 10, 20 seconds, there.
> INCO and his team want to move the S-IVB IU frequency below the LM frequency to solve the tracking problem. The frequencies could be changed by dragging them with a emitted signal from the ground once the link was locked in. But if the signals dragged across each other, both would snap together and become inseparable, and the S-IVB link couldn't be restarted remotely, so the LM had to discontinue their link while the other signal passed through its range.

[59 13 10] FLIGHT
Okay. Well, let's just standby on that.

[59 13 11] INCO
Okay.

[59 13 16 - 59 13 17] FLIGHT
Okay. Now, before we get into that one -

[59 13 26] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[59 13 27] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 13 28 - 59 13 30] GUIDO
We'd like to have a VERB 74 some time when they can skip the DSKY.

[59 13 31 - 59 13 38] FLIGHT
Okay, GUIDANCE. CAPCOM, we're reading for an E-MEMORY dump. They'll give us a VERB 74, that's what you're talking about, isn't it, GUIDANCE?

[59 13 38] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[59 13 39] FLIGHT
We're getting an E-MEMORY dump.

[59 13 49 - 59 13 52] FLIGHT
CONTROL, FLIGHT. You saw an increase in the ascent tanks, is that right? Pressure?

[59 13 53] CONTROL
Yes.

[59 13 54 - 59 13 56] FLIGHT
And you want to be sure, what, that the ascent feeds are closed -

[59 13 56 - 59 14 01] CONTROL
Yeah. Pull those breakers and cycle those valves closed. Do not cycle to the open position, just to the close position.

[59 14 03] CAPCOM (off loop)
- when he pressurized the -

[59 14 04 - 59 14 10] FLIGHT
Yeah, RCS. And we want to do an E-MEMORY dump whenever they can get around to it, we're all ready to receive it.

[59 14 11 - 59 14 12] CONTROL
Okay, I've got one item, FLIGHT.

[59 14 13] FLIGHT
Say again?

[59 14 14 -] CONTROL
This is CONTROL. We want to power down his inverters -

[59 14 19] CAPCOM
Coming at you.

[- 59 14 33] CONTROL
- and in order to do that, we're going to have to look at his middle gimbal angle for him on the ground. And to make it easier, he needs to get out of this MIN IMPULSE mode. He needs to go to - PNGS MODE CONTROL to AUTO when he gets to an attitude that he likes.

[59 14 34 - 59 14 35] FLIGHT
That's - yeah. Okay.

[59 14 37 - 59 14 48] FLIGHT
But now, wait a minute. Before we do any of that, I want to hear what it is control configuration we're going to be in, and whether we can keep the PNGS up or whether we're going to bring the AGS up, etc.

[59 14 49] CONTROL
Okay.

[59 14 50 - 59 14 52] FLIGHT
I want to get the holes dug before we start doing more things.

[59 14 52] CONTROL
Roger.

[59 14 55 - 59 15 07] FLIGHT
Let me see if - have you heard that one of the suggestions is to align the AGS to the PNGS, power the PNGS down, use the AGS, and bring the PNGS back up and do a P52 for the burn?
> The AGS was limited but sufficient for maintaining the platform and less power-hungry than the PNGS.

[59 15 08] CONTROL
That's right, FLIGHT.

[59 15 09 - 59 15 15] FLIGHT
Okay. Well, I'd like to get that whole complex of control modes and what we're going to do in currents sorted out before we start changing things.

[59 15 16] CONTROL
Okay.

[59 15 17 - 59 15 19] FLIGHT
Or we'll be doing this all night. Okay, Hal?

[59 15 20] CONTROL
Roger.

[59 15 21 - 59 15 25] FLIGHT
And I'm open to any suggestions here as to what the reasonable course of action - the last I heard from -

[59 15 28 - 59 15 31] FLIGHT
- staff is that they're going to try to run that again in the simulator, I believe.

[59 15 33] CONTROL
Okay.

[59 16 20] PROCEDURES
FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.

[59 16 22] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 16 22 - 59 16 24] PROCEDURES
Roger, we're going to have to write a restart. 10 second loss of data.

[59 16 26 - 59 16 28] FLIGHT
Okay, everybody. Stand by for 10 second loss of data.

[59 17 03 - 59 17 04] FLIGHT
- yeah. CONTROL, FLIGHT.

[59 17 06 - 59 17 07] FLIGHT
Hal? CONTROL, FLIGHT.

[59 17 10] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[59 17 11 - 59 17 14] FLIGHT
Hal, Tom Stafford's coming over. Would you chat with him about this thing?

[59 17 15 - 59 17 16] CONTROL
On the - PNGS/AGS?

[59 17 17] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[59 17 17] CONTROL
Roger.

[59 17 18] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[59 17 19] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 17 19 - 59 17 20] GUIDO
We got a good E-MOD, FLIGHT.

[59 17 21 - 59 17 27] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. We got a good E-MOD. Do they need to terminate anything, GUIDANCE, or does it terminate? Oh, it terminates.

[59 17 27] GUIDO
No, it's okay.

[59 17 28] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 18 15 - 59 18 18] FLIGHT
And that's the Atlantic, too, Jack, for their info. That's the Atlantic.

[59 18 34 - 59 18 38] FLIGHT
Yeah - we haven't made our mind we want to go there, but that's the PAD - that's the abort data he has in board.

[59 18 45 - 59 18 46] FLIGHT
It's the minimum return.

[59 18 50] FLIGHT
Yeah.

[59 18 56] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[59 18 57] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[59 18 58 - 59 19 02] GUIDO
We'd like to send him a REFSMMAT sometime, FLIGHT. If he gives P00 and ACCEPT.

[59 19 03] FLIGHT
What kind of REFSMMAT?

[59 19 04 - 59 19 13] GUIDO
It's the one that they're aligned to. They were carrying one pre - prelaunch, and it's not the one that they're aligned to right now. We're going to give them the right matrix.

[59 19 16 - 59 19 17] FLIGHT
Okay, and then what does he do? Align to it?

[59 19 18 - 59 19 20] GUIDO
No, no. He's fine. We just need to get it in there.

[59 19 21 - 59 19 22] FLIGHT
Oh, so he has it on board?

[59 19 23] GUIDO
Right.

[59 19 26 - 59 19 28] FLIGHT
Okay. Okay, CAPCOM - are you ready to do that now?

[59 19 28] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[59 19 29 - 59 19 30] FLIGHT
Do you want to send them a state vector, too? By the -

[59 19 31 - 59 19 32] GUIDO
Negative, FLIGHT. We want to hold off on that.

[59 19 32] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 19 33 - 59 19 38] GUIDO
I'm not sure what the LM will do with it. We're having MIT run the hybrid, and see what it would do with this kind of -

[59 19 38 - 59 19 39] FLIGHT
Oh, that's right, because it doesn't navigate out here.

[59 19 40 - 59 19 42] GUIDO
That's right. So, we're having them run it on the hybrid, and check it out -

[59 19 42 - 59 19 47] FLIGHT
The REFSMMAT - I'm not - GUIDANCE, say one more time why you want them to have a REFSMMAT, because he doesn't have one -

[59 19 48 -] GUIDO
He doesn't have the one he's aligned to right now, FLIGHT -

[59 19 50] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 59 19 52] GUIDO
- he aligned to the PTC and he was carrying another one.

[59 19 53] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 19 56 - 59 19 57] FLIGHT
Yeah. We want him to have the one he's aligned to.

[59 19 58 - 59 20 00] GUIDO
And we're also going to stick a TFN in, FLIGHT.

[59 20 03 - 59 20 05] CAPCOM
Alright, you want P00 and DATA now? You ready to go?

[59 20 05 - 59 20 06] GUIDO
That's affirm. We're ready.

[59 20 33] FLIGHT
Go ahead, GUIDANCE.

[59 20 34] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT. We're picking up.

[59 20 53] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[59 20 54] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 20 54 - 59 20 55] INCO
Can we try that procedure now?

[59 20 58 -] FLIGHT
Just a minute, Ed. Let me see what else is cooking, I don't have any -

[59 21 01] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[- 59 21 03] FLIGHT
- reason why not to. Go ahead, GUIDANCE.

[59 21 03 - 59 21 06] GUIDO
We don't have the DUA. He gave us P00, but he didn't give us the DUA.

[59 21 10 - 59 21 11] FLIGHT
Okay, we need the DATA position, right?

[59 21 12] INCO
Roger.

[59 21 12] GUIDO
Roger.

[59 21 13 - 59 21 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.

[59 21 16] CAPCOM
Go, FLIGHT.

[59 21 17 - 59 21 21] FLIGHT
We got program 00 but he needs to go to DATA first to get the load in.

[59 21 29 - 59 21 30] FLIGHT
Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT -

[59 21 39] INCO
That's probably what it is, FLIGHT.

[59 21 40] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 21 42] FLIGHT (off loop)
Yeah, they'll have to.

[59 21 51] INCO
We've got it, FLIGHT.

[59 21 52] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 21 53] GUIDO
We're picking up, FLIGHT.

[59 21 57 - 59 22 04] FLIGHT
Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT. We've got the VERB 74. CONTROL, FLIGHT, did you see him cycle the valves on the ascent feed?

[59 22 05] CONTROL
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[59 22 06 - 59 22 08] FLIGHT
Did he cycle the valves on the ascent feed? Jack says he did it.

[59 22 09 - 59 22 11] CONTROL
Okay, we can't see that he did it, FLIGHT, on TM.

[59 22 12] FLIGHT
Okay, but he did do it.

[59 22 13] CONTROL
Okay, FLIGHT, thank you.

[59 22 14 - 59 22 15] FLIGHT
Okay. He cycled the ascent feeds - -

[59 22 22 - 59 22 32] FLIGHT
Okay, now, we're working on what we're going to do with the configuration. We need to get some kind of PTC going for us here, and we need to decide what we want to do with our control configuration - you're working all that, huh, CONTROL?

[59 22 33] CONTROL
Trying my best to, FLIGHT.

[59 22 34] FLIGHT
Okay.

[59 22 36 - 59 22 38] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. We're coming up on AFT OMNI for the LM.

[59 22 39] FLIGHT
Do you want us to switch now?

[59 22 40] INCO
Right.

[59 22 41] FLIGHT
We're right in the middle of a load.

[59 22 42 - 59 22 44] INCO
Okay, we won't - hold as long as we can.

[59 22 48 - 59 22 49] INCO
He got it pretty quick on there anyway.

[59 27 40] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[59 27 41] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 27 41 - 59 27 42] GUIDO
We're through COMMANDing to the LM.

[59 27 43] FLIGHT
Through COMMANDing, CAPCOM.

[59 27 47] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[59 27 48] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 27 49 - 59 27 50] TELMU
I'd like to go ahead and get that DUA off the line.

[59 27 51 - 59 27 55] FLIGHT
Okay. We're through COMMANDing, CAPCOM, and they can take that circuit breaker - the DUA circuit breaker out again.

[59 27 56] TELMU
And FLIGHT, TELMU.

[59 27 57] FLIGHT
Go.

[59 27 59 - 59 28 05] TELMU
We'd like to get as much gear off here as we can. We'd like for you to think about turning this inverter off.

[59 28 06 - 59 28 07] FLIGHT
Again, here? Which inverter?

[59 28 08 - 59 28 09] TELMU
The LM inverter. Inverter 2.

[59 28 10 - 59 28 17] FLIGHT
It's running the eight-ball. Yeah, I need to tie that together with how we're going to fly this thing, Merlin - I'm waiting to get this whole thing.

[59 28 18] TELMU
Understand, but -

[59 28 19] FLIGHT
I understand what you're saying.

[59 28 20] TELMU
Okay.
