One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what BEAM WIDTH.

[55 49 25 - 55 50 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239° in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to 0 and pitch would go to 90.

Okay. Your SECONDARY RAD IN, I gave to you 70 - about 72°; the RAD OUT is about 30; the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP is reading about 65; STEAM PRESSURE full scale high, GLYCOL DISCHARGE PRESSURE about 9 psi. The ACCUM - SECONDARY ACCUMULATOR is about 30 - 34%.

[56 54 01 - 56 54 19] LMP
Our temperatures: SUITS showing about 52°; CABIN about 58°; pressures, SUIT reading 4.1, CABIN at 5. PARTIAL PRESSURE CO₂ is up to a little over 1, about 1.1.

[56 54 21 - 56 54 47] LMP
On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72°, helium's reading 3500; N₂ A is reading 2300; N₂ B about 2450. And our ullage pressures: FUEL is reading about 165; OXIDIZER 170.

Fuel cells: FUEL CELL 1, both CLOSED, they're zip; SKIN TEMP 405°; CONDENSER EXHAUST is lower scale. FUEL CELL 2 - right now we've got an O₂ - an H₂ FLOW reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O₂ FLOW is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also {given us MAIN BUS A undervolts} from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high.
1> As thrusters used power when they fired and each load drops the voltage, the thrusters could trigger undervolt warnings when they engaged.

[56 55 34 - 56 56 03] LMP
The T-SKIN is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17, correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: FUEL CELL 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48, again depending on thruster activity.

[58 44 10 - 58 44 13] LMP
Okay. What page is that there gyro torquing?

[58 44 13 - 58 44 17] CDR
Okay, what page is the, do we write the gyro torquing angles on, Jack?

[58 44 19] CAPCOM
Standby.

[58 44 20 - 58 44 24] LMP
Okay. We're there now, Jim. Jim's got it. Go ahead with the gyro torquing angles.

[58 44 26 - 58 44 43] CAPCOM
Okay. We'd like you to proceed with the fine align and your gyro torquing angles are X +003.30, Y +024.80, Z -015.10. Over.

[58 44 50 - 58 45 07] CDR
Okay, I read the gyro torquing angles as +003.30, Y is +023 - I only have four numbers for Y, you'll have to give that one to me again - and Z is -015.10. Read Y again, please.

[58 45 08 - 58 45 13] CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. X and Z are correct, and Y is +024.80.

[58 45 22 - 58 45 29] CDR
Okay. We read Y as +024.80. We'll proceed on Activation 40 to fine align the platform.

[58 45 30] CAPCOM
Roger.

[58 45 39 - 58 45 43] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, proceed as on page 40 with the IMU fine align.

[58 47 04] CDR
Okay, the way to do that -

[58 47 43 - 58 47 46] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Can you see any stars out the LM window?

[58 47 55 - 58 47 59] LMP
We'll have to wipe them off, Jack. They're coated with water right now.

[58 48 01] CDR
Can I get a towel?

[58 48 03 - 58 48 12] CAPCOM
Roger. As soon as you get a chance to - or in a position to - take a look, we'd like to know if you can see stars for alignment purposes.

[58 48 18 - 58 48 22] LMP
Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble in our present attitude out his side.

[58 48 23] CDR
The Sun's there.

[58 48 27] CDR
Wait 1.

[58 48 38 - 58 48 47] LMP
What have you got? How much you got left in battery A? Okay. I wish I knew what the hell they were thinking right now -

[58 48 53 - 58 48 57] CDR
They're talking about powering down and doing a P51 here?

[58 48 58 - 58 49 01] LMP
No, they were just thinking about P52 -

[58 49 02 - 58 49 19] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston, negative on the P51. We want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. And so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation.

[58 49 24 - 58 49 27] CDR
Would you say that one more time? Give me the top tier - the top tier.

[58 49 35 - 58 50 01] CAPCOM
Jim, what we want you to do is go with your current fine align and disregard the P51. What we're attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the LMS window to see if that will help us any. So when you can see some stars, if you can - you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations, please let us know.

[58 50 04 - 58 50 05] CDR
Okay, we'll check. Standby.

[58 50 18] CDR
Okay, watch the -

[58 52 14 - 58 52 28] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We notice that the O₂ pressure in ASCENT TANK O₂ is a little high, so we want to use some of it. So close DESCENT O₂ and open ASCENT O₂ TANK 2. Over.

[58 54 06 - 58 54 08] CAPCOM
Reading you five square, Jim. Go ahead.

[58 54 11 - 58 54 25] CDR
Okay. I'm looking out of Fred's window. I see a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us; so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and I don't recognize any constellations right now in this particular attitude.

[58 54 36 - 58 54 39] CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. If that status changes, please let us know.

[58 54 47 - 58 54 48] CDR
Roger. We're continuing to drift.

Okay. What was the last two this you gave me, a pitch and roll angle for what?

[59 03 49 - 59 03 50] CAPCOM
That's for your DPS trim.

Wait a minute. Do you - you fight roll by using the TTCA left/right. That's what you need to play with.

[59 06 05 - 59 06 11] CDR
Okay, we'll try that. Let me get around though. Let's roll. Let it roll all the way.

[59 06 12 - 59 06 13] LMP
Yeah, you can't let it roll all the way!

What else can we fill up there?

[59 10 01 - 59 10 23] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We're not going to be able to uplink your time because of the IU, and we have a frequency problem there. But what I'd like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the DSKY from there. Over.

[59 10 26 - 59 10 27] CDR
Okay, standby.

[59 10 28 - 59 10 31] LMP
Wait a minute. Why do we need a mission timer right now, anyway? I mean, that bad - they'd tell us.

[59 10 33 - 59 10 37] CDR
Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we - then we can put it in the DSKY. Then we shut down the mission timer.

Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better way of getting your mission time up.

[59 11 58] CDR
Go ahead with it.

You got it.

[59 14 25 - 59 14 56] CAPCOM
Okay. And one other thing we noticed: when you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel 11, close the ASCENT FEED 1 and 2 circuit breakers - and cycle the Parker valves, and then open the ASCENT FEED circuit breakers on panel 11.

[59 41 50 - 59 41 53] CAPCOM
Roger, that sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why don't you go ahead with that one?

[59 43 01 - 59 43 39] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. Down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth. And as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at docked burns and also trying to see what kind of alignment procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. So if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alignment out the window, why let us know.

[59 43 43 - 59 44 04] CDR
Okay, Jack. Right now we're not able to. The sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find. And why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the LMS run, is that correct?

[59 44 06 - 59 44 13] CAPCOM
That's affirm. We'd like to correlate what information we get with yours, so that if we can use it to update the platform, we can.

[59 44 24 - 59 44 30] CAPCOM
What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS align so we can power down the platform.

[59 45 26 - 59 45 31] CDR
Houston, Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all.

Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient the LM so that the Service Module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then.

Okay, hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the question we have is: is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the Service Module is between the LM and the Sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? And secondly, can you see anything out the AOT?

Okay, we've got a lot of background static, Jack. You're down in the mud. You having a ground problem?

[59 59 25 - 59 59 38] CAPCOM
What we tried to do was to get the IU frequency shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less interference. I think it'll come up - what we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen. Over.

Okay. That's the first clear word we've heard from you, Jack. Do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? I guess you've been hearing us.

We have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. I hope we have it corrected now.

Okay. That sounds good.

[60 04 54 - 60 05 11] CAPCOM
We're considering powering down the PGNS but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine align. We read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good. How about out the AOT?

[60 05 27] LMP
He's looking now.

[60 05 30 - 60 05 38] CAPCOM
Okay, and the other thing we thought you might try is to put the Service Module between you and the Sun, and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude.

[60 05 44 - 60 05 56] Guest CAPCOM
The reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the constellations all recognizable when we put the Service Module - in our case the LM, between us and the Sun.

Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How me, now?

[60 22 56 - 60 22 58] CDR
Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack. I hope it stays this time.

[60 23 00 - 60 23 37] CAPCOM
Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we've got. But we'd like to get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible.

[60 23 40 - 60 23 47] CAPCOM
That would be after the midcourse and - so, how do you feel about making a 16 foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?

[60 23 51 - 60 23 58] CDR
Well we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all we've got. That's a 16 foot-per-second DPS burn in 37 minutes?

[60 23 59 - 60 24 03] CAPCOM
Roger. We're working up a PAD for it, but we want to know what you think about doing it at that time.

[60 24 09 - 60 24 11] CDR
Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little bit more time?

[60 24 32 - 60 24 45] CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time from you. We can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a PAD.

[60 24 49 - 60 24 55] CDR
Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a little bit more time - we want to do it right. Standby 1.

[60 25 06 - 60 25 08] CDR
Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's that?
> Prepping for a midcourse burn was normally scheduled for around 75 minutes, and that's with the ready-to-go SM SPS. The LM DPS normally took 2 hours to activate, so even an hour is rather compressed.

[60 25 17 - 60 25 21] CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes? That's an hour and 5 from now.

[60 25 26 - 60 25 30] CDR
Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth, now, to make sure we get this burn off right.

[60 25 33] CAPCOM
Affirm.

[60 25 36 - 60 25 45] LMP
Okay. In the interim, Jack, I looked around again and I saw that we have a radar and a landing-radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?
> CONTROL noticed these around 58:02 and 58:11, but the instruction never made it up to pull them.

[60 25 47 - 60 25 48] CAPCOM
Affirmative. Pull them both out.

[60 25 54 - 60 26 12] CAPCOM
And now we want to ask you a question about alignments and so forth: we wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if you could use the Service Module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a P51 COAS alignment.

[60 26 16 - 60 26 38] CDR
Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We - we're just not able to see them at all. Now, we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll, and see stars. Right now, we haven't been able to. The AOT is useless. The Command Module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope.

[60 26 43 - 60 26 52] CAPCOM
Okay. And how about using the Service Module to cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you do that, can you see stars for a COAS alignment?

[60 26 57 - 60 27 11] CDR
We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to do it; the light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth and Moon, if that can be of assistance.

[60 27 20 - 60 27 36] LMP
Another problem: right now, Jack, I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's real and not real.

[60 27 41 - 60 27 57] FLIGHT
Okay. That's good information. And during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.

[60 28 00 - 60 28 19] CDR
Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question: in this configuration, docked, we have to use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles to play with.
> Lovell is concerned, because with the weight of the CSM attached to the LM the controls normally used to rotate the spacecraft don't do much (imaging twiddling a long stick between two fingers at its middle as opposed to at its ends), so he has to use the controls normally used to strafe the spacecraft around. But this has the potential to alter the trajectory of the spacecraft, and this close to the Moon very small adjustments can turn into miles of difference at the very far point.

[60 28 24 - 60 28 25] CAPCOM
Roger. We'll put that to them.

[60 28 47 - 60 28 54] LMP
Okay, Jack. Are you ready to go to work with me on the 2-hour DPS activation and contingency book, page 1?

[60 28 56 - 60 28 57] CAPCOM
Roger. We're ready to go.

[60 29 07 - 60 29 13] LMP
Okay, item 1 we can - 1 through 5 we can scratch off as done. Is that correct?

[60 29 17] CAPCOM
Standby 1, Fred.

[60 30 21 - 60 30 24] CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. Let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1. Everybody's listening.

[60 30 30 - 60 30 40] LMP
Okay. I've looked around, and I've essentially done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights, and I think we'll just do without those.

[60 30 42] CAPCOM
Roger. Your choice.

[60 30 49 - 60 30 58] LMP
Okay. On EPS activation, we're through step - we're through that - bottom of that page. That's all done.

[60 31 00 - 60 31 01] CAPCOM
We concur. Page 2.

[60 31 15 - 60 31 25] LMP
Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and we're not sitting with all 4 acs - descent BATs on high-voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.

[60 31 30 - 60 31 34] CAPCOM
Roger, and in step 5 we want to leave INVERTER 1 circuit breaker OPEN.

[60 31 40 - 60 31 42] LMP
Roger. In step 5, we'll leave INVERTER 1 CB OPEN.

[60 31 43] CAPCOM
Omit step 6.

[60 31 56 - 60 32 04] LMP
Okay. For the time being, our mission timer is the computer. So mission timer activation - scratch off.

[60 32 07] CAPCOM
Roger.

[60 32 12 - 60 32 15] LMP
Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop activation.

Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3.

[60 32 39 - 60 32 59] LMP
Okay, I was going to say that next. Page 3 we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've already got the RCS heaters on. And I don't know if I gave you the time or you got the time on the PRIMARY EVAP FLOW number 1 OPEN.

[60 33 05] CAPCOM
We got the time.

However, Fred, we need the ATCA breaker IN.

[60 46 31 - 60 46 32] LMP
Okay, ATCA breaker's IN.

[60 46 37 - 60 46 38] LMP
Yeah - I guess for the backup power supply.

Okay, Freddo, we don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. So it looks like you ought to open up COMM S-BAND ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.

[60 48 35 - 60 48 39] LMP
Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, and S-BAND HEATER breaker is still CLOSED.

[60 49 28 - 60 49 47] LMP
And on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had pulled before, and EPS DISPLAY. But I question: do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as prescribed?

[60 49 49] CAPCOM
Standby.

[60 49 53 - 60 49 56] CAPCOM
That's a negative on the ASCENT ECA breaker, leave it OPEN.

[60 50 04 -] CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we need P00 and DATA -

[60 50 06 - 60 50 07] LMP
And that's a -

[- 60 50 09] CAPCOM
- and we'll give you a state vector and target load.

[60 50 14 - 60 50 16] LMP
Okay. We need the UP LINK breaker in, then, now.

[60 50 19] CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

[60 50 25 - 60 50 31] CDR
Okay. And Jack, will you give us that - how about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that? We don't need that, do we?

[60 50 34 - 60 50 35] CAPCOM
Negative on the ORDEAL. Leave it OPEN.

[60 50 50 - 60 50 55] LMP
And how about the ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11? Jim has it in over there.

[60 51 03 - 60 51 05] CAPCOM
And on panel 11, ASCENT ECA can be OPEN.

[60 51 09] CDR
It's OPEN.

[60 51 29 - 60 51 32] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're GO on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now.

[60 51 38] LMP
Roger.

[60 52 06 - 60 52 13] CAPCOM
And Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your attitude for you, it will.

[60 52 18] CDR
Okay, very well.

[60 52 32 - 60 52 38] CDR
And Jack, because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude, I think we ought to think about going there very shortly.

[60 52 40] CAPCOM
Roger. I have a PAD for you.

[60 52 44 - 60 52 45] CAPCOM
I have a P30 maneuver PAD.

[60 52 51 - 60 52 52] CDR
Roger - standby.

[60 53 01 - 60 53 06] CAPCOM
Okay, they want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the LOAD. We haven't completed it yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver PAD?

[60 53 09] CDR
That's affirm.

[60 53 11 - 60 54 42] CAPCOM
Okay, here we go. The purpose is midcourse correction for free-return. NOUN 33: {061:29:42.84}. {-0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2}. {HA and HP are N/A, ∆V 0038.0}. {0:31}. {120, 298}. {-0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2}. COAS N/A. And I have your LM GDA angles: pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Your DPS throttling: 5 seconds at 10%, burn the rest at 40%. Your ullage will be 2 jets for 10 seconds.
1> NOUN 33: time of burn
2> NOUN 81: change in velocity (∆V in fps)
3> NOUN 42: apogee, perigee, total ∆V
4> Burn duration
5> FDAI roll and pitch
6> NOUN 86: change in velocity (∆V in fps) in the AGS coordinate space

[60 54 59 - 60 56 02] LMP
Okay, Jack. We have a P30 maneuver PAD, a midcourse for free-return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84. -0021.3, +004.1, -0031.2. HA and NP N/A, ∆VR 0038.0. 0:31. 120, 298. -0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2. DPS throttle 5 seconds at 10%, burn the rest at 40%. And we need a 2-jet, 10 second ullage.

[60 56 03 - 60 56 11] CAPCOM
That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify, however, in NOUN 81 in VY, it's plus three balls 41.

[60 56 16 - 60 56 22] LMP
Okay. NOUN 81, VY is +0004.1.

[60 56 23 - 60 56 26] CAPCOM
Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.

[60 56 29 - 60 56 32] CDR
Okay. And Jack, find out about using TTCA to maneuver with.

[60 56 34 - 60 56 39] CAPCOM
Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's yours. And we recommend using the TTCA to maneuver with.

[60 56 43] CDR
Roger.

[60 56 44 - 60 56 55] LMP
Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6, Jack. Under PGNS turn-on and self-test, we've done everything except the self-test here on this page. Do you want to do that at this time?

[60 57 30 - 60 57 33] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. Negative on the PGNS self-test. Page 7.

[60 57 38 - 60 57 56] LMP
Okay. I'll scratch page 6. And on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather, we've had the S-BAND activated, ECS Activation I have all done. And at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU coarse align is done.

[60 58 05] CAPCOM
Roger.

[60 58 17 - 60 58 21] LMP
We've - okay, we've also completed, I guess in essence, all of page 8.

[60 58 23 - 60 58 28] CAPCOM
That's affirmative, and page 9 to boot. Scratch VHF; we've done the T-ephems.

[60 58 38 - 60 58 40] LMP
Okay, you've updated it, that's right. We cranked in the time.

[60 58 54 - 60 58 58] CDR
And Houston, let's go to Activation - or get into page 10 and see what we do there.

[60 59 00 - 60 59 02] CAPCOM
Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear.

[60 59 07 - 60 59 08] CDR
Okay. We'll do that now.

[61 00 11 - 61 00 20] LMP
Okay. The landing gear are down and locked, Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that.

[61 00 25 - 61 00 27] CAPCOM
We verify that. Page 12.

[61 00 32 - 61 00 39] LMP
Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up, we got a REFSMMAT and STATE VECTOR, is that correct?

[61 00 40 - 61 00 44] CAPCOM
That's affirmative. You've got that, so you can delete page 12.

[61 00 52 - 61 00 57] LMP
Hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine align angles and we've cranked those in.

[61 01 02] CAPCOM
Affirmative.

[61 01 09 - 61 01 14] LMP
Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do a DAP set, the gimbal/throttle test.

[61 01 14] CAPCOM
That's -

[61 01 21 - 61 01 31] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just make sure the gimbal - DECA POWER and DECA GIMBAL circuit breakers are closed.

[61 01 35 - 61 01 40] LMP
Okay. We're going to proceed now with the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or did you say delete it?

[61 01 41 - 61 01 47] CAPCOM
Aquarius, delete the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just ensure that the DECA POWER and the DECA GIMBAL are closed.

[61 01 51 - 61 01 54] CDR
Okay, Houston. DECA POWER is OPEN at this time. Do you want me to close it?

[61 01 56 - 61 01 58] CAPCOM
Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA POWER.

[61 02 01 - 61 02 02] CDR
It's CLOSED. We deleted that.

[61 02 29 - 61 02 34] LMP
Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the COMMANDER'S THROTTLE set to THROTTLE and MIN.

[61 02 59] LMP
Houston -

[61 03 02 - 61 03 10] LMP
if I recall the launch set of the gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where are we going to get those set for the burn?

[61 03 34 - 61 03 44] CAPCOM
Okay, here's the word on the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and that'll get our gimbal set.

[61 04 21 - 61 04 35] LMP
Okay, Jack. We're going to have to back up on this if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go MODE CONTROL PGNS AUTO. We're going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep from firing jets.

[61 04 53 - 61 04 54] CAPCOM
Standby, Fred.

[61 05 29 - 61 05 31] CAPCOM
Standby on step 1, Fred. We're getting the word for you.

[61 05 34 - 61 05 35] CAPCOM
How do you like this sim?
> Though many emergency scenarios were rigorously simulated and trained for by a simulation team that prided themselves on putting everybody through the wringer, many of the failure modes on Apollo 13 were never simulated or planned for as it was assumed the vehicle would simply be an immediate catastrophic loss.

[61 05 42] CDR
It's a beauty.

[61 06 10 - 61 06 17] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the DAP set and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist. Go PGNS AUTO and proceed.

[61 06 21 - 61 06 27] CDR
Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want us to do that and stop?

[61 06 51 - 61 06 56] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to AUTO, let the thrusters fire and settle down, and proceed with the test.

[61 07 06 - 61 07 07] CDR
We're in PGNS AUTO.

[61 07 09 - 61 07 11] CAPCOM
Roger. Your DAP is set, you're in wide deadband; that ought to do the trick.

[61 07 15] CDR
Roger.

[61 07 20 - 61 07 22] CAPCOM
Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius; we're ready to proceed with the test.

[61 07 26 - 61 07 27] LMP
Okay, we're proceeding.

[61 07 52 - 61 07 53] LMP
Okay, and Houston, you -

[61 07 55 - 61 07 57] LMP
- you're looking at the weights now. Those are still good, right?

[61 08 01] CAPCOM
You're GO on the weights.

[61 09 06 - 61 09 13] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.

[61 11 05 - 61 11 14] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal and we notice that we've got a 4-jet ullage loaded in the DAP and we gave you 2 jets on the PAD. But let's go with what we've got loaded. It'll be a 4-jet ullage.

[61 11 18] LMP
Okay.

[61 11 41 - 61 11 43] LMP
Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?

[61 11 45 - 61 11 46] CAPCOM
The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.

[61 12 09 - 61 12 11] CDR
Okay, Houston. We're going to do the DPS pressurization and checkout.

[61 12 16] CAPCOM
Standby 1.

[61 12 34 - 61 12 38] CAPCOM
Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready for the DPS pressurization and checkout.

[61 13 33 - 61 13 44] LMP
Okay, Houston. Do you want to follow up on page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've kind of already done that.

[61 13 47 - 61 13 49] CAPCOM
You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS checkout.

[61 13 52 - 61 13 53] CAPCOM
And the DPS looks GO.

[61 15 42 - 61 15 44] CDR
Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver to the attitude.

[61 15 47] CAPCOM
Standby on that.

[61 15 53 - 61 15 58] CAPCOM
Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.

[61 15 59 - 61 16 01] CDR
Okay, we have to use the TTCA. Roger.

[61 21 09 - 61 21 11] CDR
We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp the rates. We're at the attitude.

[61 21 21 - 61 21 22] CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.

[61 21 26] CDR
Roger.

[61 23 36 - 61 23 41] LMP
And Houston, we'd like to confirm: do you want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?

[61 23 43 - 61 23 45] CAPCOM
Affirmative on the VERB 65.

[61 23 48] LMP
Okay.

[61 24 11 - 61 24 21] LMP
Okay, Jack. I've got another question on page 18. At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE breaker in.

[61 24 26 - 61 24 27] LMP
We sure don't want any staging now.
> This would drop the descent stage of the LM, which they need for getting home, as in addition to the better engine it contained consumables.

[61 24 37 - 61 24 40] CAPCOM
Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker CLOSE. Leave it OPEN.

[61 24 45 - 61 24 46] LMP
Roger. Will delete.

[61 24 54 - 61 25 00] LMP
Okay. Also, Jack, since we have 4-jet ullage versus 2, do you want - still want 10 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now?

[61 25 08 - 61 25 11] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.

[61 25 17 - 61 25 20] LMP
Okay. We'll just let the 7.5 second AUTO ullage do it.

[61 25 22 - 61 25 30] CAPCOM
Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle, so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down, THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL - vice AUTO.

[61 25 34 - 61 25 36] LMP
Okay. We're set to MANUAL.

[61 25 57 - 61 25 58] CDR
What's the 203 -

[61 26 05] CAPCOM
ENTER on the 203, Jim.

[61 26 10 - 61 26 12] CDR
We've got 203 on the DSKY now and it looks as though it requires work. Can we pass it?

[61 26 15 - 61 26 16] CAPCOM
Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.

[61 26 21] CDR
We hit ENTER.

[61 26 50 - 61 26 53] CAPCOM
Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the MIN position.

[61 26 57] CDR
That's affirm.

[61 26 59 - 61 27 11] CAPCOM
And in the event that you have to do a manual takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand contr - use the TTCA.

[61 28 13 - 61 28 14] LMP
Okay, 1 +30 to burn.

[61 28 20] CAPCOM
Roger.

[61 28 45] LMP
Okay. MASTER ARM's ON. 1 minute.

[61 28 52 - 61 28 53] CAPCOM
Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.

[61 29 54] CDR
40 percent.

[61 30 03 - 61 30 04] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.

[61 30 25] CDR
AUTO SHUTDOWN.

[61 30 40 - 61 30 41] LMP
Okay, you're looking at {16 85} now, Jack.
1> VERB 16 NOUN 85, which displays the control axis information (??).

[61 30 46 - 61 30 48] CAPCOM
Okay, you're GO on the residuals; proceed.

[61 30 54 - 61 30 58] LMP
Okay, when you say GO on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. Is that right?

[61 30 59 - 61 31 01] CAPCOM
That's affirmative. No trim required.

[61 32 17 - 61 32 19] CAPCOM
Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.

[61 32 44 - 61 32 50] CDR
Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to talk about powerdown, and what you want us to do with the PGNS.

[61 32 52 - 61 32 55] CAPCOM
Roger. We're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word.

[61 33 19 - 61 33 40] CDR
And Houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alignment is with the Earth and the terminator or the Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS if at all possible.

[61 33 48 - 61 33 50] CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.

[61 35 24 - 61 35 27] CDR
And Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode. Can we turn off the buses?

[61 35 40 - 61 35 42] CAPCOM
Standby on that one, Jim.

[61 38 13 - 61 38 29] CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line; so on panel 11, open DECA POWER and open DECA GIMBAL. On 16, open the ATCA breaker.

[61 38 36 - 61 38 42] LMP
Okay. On 11, we've got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL OPEN. On 16, we've got the ATCA breaker OPEN.

[61 39 38 - 61 39 49] CDR
And Houston, while you're thinking, see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the Command Module optics with manual drive, if I have to look for stars.

[61 39 52] CAPCOM
Roger.

[61 41 24 - 61 41 39] CDR
And Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking - before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting to know what to - whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't freeze up the normal urine dump feed.

[61 41 45 - 61 41 51] CAPCOM
Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry, you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for urine dump.

[61 41 55] CDR
Okay.

[61 41 56 - 61 41 59] CAPCOM
And how are the stars out the window now?

[61 42 13 - 61 42 33] CDR
Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude the Sun is reflecting off of - off of Quad 4 so bright that it's ruining any night vision. And we've still got particles floating around us. I'll have to take a long look and see if I can see any star patterns.

[61 42 34] CAPCOM
Roger.

[61 42 43 - 61 42 55] CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?

[61 42 59 - 61 43 00] CDR
Okay, standby 1.

[61 43 10 - 61 43 14] CDR
Okay, I understand you want us to turn off the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER and bring it up in 5 minutes. Is that correct?

[61 43 16] CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

[61 43 20] CDR
Tell us when.

[61 43 42 - 61 43 43] CDR
And you want us to maintain attitude control?

[61 43 46 - 61 43 47] CAPCOM
Affirmative on the attitude control.

[61 43 48 - 61 43 53] CDR
That's AUTO attitude control. Okay. We'll maintain AUTO attitude control.

[61 43 56 - 61 44 08] LMP
Okay, Jack. I'm back on the line now. On the S-BAND, you want me to turn off the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER and the POWER AMPL to off for 5 minutes. Is that - when you give me the word - is that what you want?

[61 44 10 - 61 44 15] CAPCOM
Aquarius, leave the POWER AMPLIFIER the way it is. Turn the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER OFF for 5 minutes.

[61 44 17] CAPCOM
Now.

[61 44 19 - 61 44 20] LMP
Okay, you tell me - you tell me when.

[61 44 22 - 61 44 24] CAPCOM
Okay, turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.

[61 44 26 - 61 44 29] LMP
Okay, it's gone off. It's gone off for 5 minutes.

[61 51 05] LMP
- -

[61 52 44 - 61 52 46] CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[61 52 52 - 61 52 53] LMP
Okay, you're loud and clear there, Jack.

[61 52 55 - 61 52 57] CAPCOM
Roger, same here. We're all - we're still discussing the next move.

[61 53 05 - 61 53 09] LMP
I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.

[61 53 18 - 61 54 12] CAPCOM
We're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the LGC. But we'll have more word for you shortly. And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. And we have some items that you might want to transfer to the LM: some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the moment?

[61 54 18 - 61 54 33] LMP
Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack. I understand no urine dumps; I guess we'll work through the UCD and all the bags we got. And real quick there, can you give a DAP load that we want in here now to conserve the RCS?

[61 55 21 - 61 55 31] CAPCOM
Okay. For attitude control, we're recommending manual control VERB 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now looks good.

[61 55 38 - 61 55 47] LMP
Okay, it's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on watch. And the DAP load we've got right now is okay.

[61 58 18 - 61 58 33] CAPCOM
Aquarius, our decision for this time is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power down other nonessential items. We'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.

[61 58 37 - 61 58 45] LMP
Okay. The decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.

[61 58 47] CAPCOM
Roger.

[61 59 34 - 61 59 39] CAPCOM
And Aquarius, for your information, we now have a 136 mile perigee.

[61 59 42 - 61 59 43] CAPCOM
Confirmed by doppler.

[61 59 47 - 61 59 52] LMP
Okay, 136 mile perigee now. That's very nice.

[62 00 09 - 62 00 12] LMP
Oh. Wait a minute, Jack. Did you say {pericynthion} or {perigee}?
1> Closest approach to Moon.
2> Closest approach to Earth.
> You can see why he'd be concerned about this.

[62 00 14 - 62 00 15] CAPCOM
I meant pericynthion.
